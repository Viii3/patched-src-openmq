[[who-should-use-this-book]]
Who Should Use This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is intended for administrators and application developers who
need to perform Message Queue administrative tasks. A Message Queue
administrator is responsible for setting up and managing a Message Queue
messaging system, especially the message broker at the heart of the
system.

[[GMADG00211]][[gblxf]]


[[before-you-read-this-book]]
Before You Read This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before reading this guide, you should read the link:../mq-tech-over/toc.html#GMTOV[Open Message
Queue Technical Overview] to become familiar with the Message Queue
implementation of the Java Message Service specification, with the
components of the Message Queue service, and with the basic process of
developing, deploying, and administering a Message Queue application.

[[GMADG00486]][[gbqig]]


[[directory-variable-conventions]]
Directory Variable Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue documentation makes use of three directory variables; two
of which represent environment variables needed by Message Queue. (How
you set the environment variables varies from platform to platform.)

The following table describes the directory variables that might be
found in this book and how they are used. Some of these variables refer
to the directory mqInstallHome, which is the directory where Message
Queue is installed to when using the installer or unzipped to when using
a zip-based distribution.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In this book, directory variables are shown without platform-specific
environment variable notation or syntax (such as `$IMQ_HOME` on UNIX).
Non-platform-specific path names use UNIX directory separator (`/`)
notation.

=======================================================================


[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Description
|`IMQ_HOME` a|
The Message Queue home directory:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_HOME` is as-install-parent`/mq`, where as-install-parent is the
parent directory of the GlassFish Server base installation directory,
`glassfish3` by default.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` is
mqInstallHome`/mq`.

|`IMQ_VARHOME` a|
The directory in which Message Queue temporary or dynamically created
configuration and data files are stored; `IMQ_VARHOME` can be explicitly
set as an environment variable to point to any directory or will default
as described below:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_VARHOME` defaults to
as-install-parent`/glassfish/domains/domain1/imq`.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` defaults to
mqInstallHome`/var/mq`.

|`IMQ_JAVAHOME` |An environment variable that points to the location of
the Java runtime environment (JRE) required by Message Queue executable
files. By default, Message Queue looks for and uses the latest JDK, but
you can optionally set the value of `IMQ_JAVAHOME` to wherever the
preferred JRE resides.
