B Stability of Message Queue Interfaces
---------------------------------------

Message Queue uses many interfaces that can help administrators automate
tasks. This appendix classifies the interfaces according to their
stability. The more stable an interface is, the less likely it is to
change in subsequent versions of the product.

Any interface that is not listed in this appendix is private and not for
customer use.

Classification Scheme

link:#gbnnk[Table B-1] describes the stability classification scheme.

Table B-1 Interface Stability Classification Scheme

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Classification |Description
|Private |Not for direct use by customers. May change or be removed in
any release.

|Evolving |For use by customers. Subject to incompatible change at a
major (e.g. 3.0, 4.0) or minor (e.g. 3.1, 3.2) release. The changes will
be made carefully and slowly. Reasonable efforts will be made to ensure
that all changes are compatible but that is not guaranteed.

|Stable |For use by customers. Subject to incompatible change at a major
(for example, 3.0 or 4.0) release only.

|Standard |For use by customers. These interfaces are defined by a
formal standard, and controlled by a standards organization.
Incompatible changes to these interfaces are rare.

|Unstable |For use by customers. Subject to incompatible change at a
major (e.g. 3.0, 4.0) or minor (e.g. 3.1, 3.2) release. Customers are
advised that these interfaces may be removed or changed substantially
and in an incompatible way in a future release. It is recommended that
customers not create explicit dependencies on unstable interfaces.
