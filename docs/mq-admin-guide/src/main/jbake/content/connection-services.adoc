6 Configuring and Managing Connection Services
----------------------------------------------

Message Queue offers various connection services using a variety of
transport protocols for connecting both application and administrative
clients to a broker. This chapter describes how to configure and manage
these services and the connections they support:

* link:#aeocn[Configuring Connection Services]
* link:#aeoed[Managing Connection Services]
* link:#aeoej[Managing Connections]

Configuring Connection Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Broker configuration properties related to connection services are
listed under link:broker-properties.html#aeont[Connection Properties].

link:#ghptq[Figure 6-1] shows the connection services provided by the
Message Queue broker.

"Elements of a Message Queue service showing the connection services
provided by the broker."]


These connection services are distinguished by two characteristics, as
shown in link:#gbnjw[Table 6-1]:

* The service type specifies whether the service provides JMS message
delivery (`NORMAL`) or Message Queue administration services ( `ADMIN`).
* The protocol type specifies the underlying transport protocol.

[[GMADG648]][[sthref20]][[gbnjw]]


Table 6-1 Message Queue Connection Service Characteristics

[width="100%",cols="19%,17%,64%",options="header",]
|================================================
|Service Name |Service Type |Protocol Type
|`jms` |`NORMAL` |TCP
|`ssljms` |`NORMAL` |TLS (SSL-based security)
|`httpjms` |`NORMAL` |HTTP
|`httpsjms` |`NORMAL` |HTTPS (SSL-based security)
|`admin` |`ADMIN` |TCP
|`ssladmin` |`ADMIN` |TLS (SSL-based security)
|================================================


By setting a broker's `imq.service.activelist` property, you can
configure it to run any or all of these connection services. The value
of this property is a list of connection services to be activated when
the broker is started up; if the property is not specified explicitly,
the `jms` and `admin` services will be activated by default.

Each connection service also supports specific authentication and
authorization features; see
link:security-services.html#aeocu[Introduction to Security Services] for
more information.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

There is also a special `cluster` connection service, used internally by
the brokers within a broker cluster to exchange information about the
cluster's configuration and state. This service is not intended for use
by clients communicating with a broker. See
link:broker-clusters.html#aeohv[Configuring and Managing Broker Clusters]
for more information about broker clusters.

Also there are two JMX connectors, `jmxrmi` and `ssljmxrmi`, that
support JMX-based administration. These JMX connectors are very similar
to the connection services in link:#gbnjw[Table 6-1], above, and are
used by JMX clients to establish a connection to the broker's MBean
server. For more information, see link:jmx-support.html#ggvry[JMX
Connection Infrastructure].

=======================================================================


[[aeoco]][[GMADG00526]][[port-mapper]]

Port Mapper
^^^^^^^^^^^

Each connection service is available at a particular port, specified by
host name (or IP address) and port number. You can explicitly specify a
static port number for a service or have the broker's Port Mapper assign
one dynamically. The Port Mapper itself resides at the broker's primary
port, which is normally located at the standard port number `7676`. (If
necessary, you can use the broker configuration property
`imq.portmapper.port` to override this with a different port number.) By
default, each connection service registers itself with the Port Mapper
when it starts up. When a client creates a connection to the broker, the
Message Queue client runtime first contacts the Port Mapper, requesting
a port number for the desired connection service.

Alternatively, you can override the Port Mapper and explicitly assign a
static port number to a connection service, using the
`imq`.serviceName.protocolType. `port` configuration property (where
serviceName and protocolType identify the specific connection service,
as shown in link:#gbnjw[Table 6-1]). (Only the `jms`, `ssljms`, `admin`,
and `ssladmin` connection services can be configured this way; the
`httpjms` and `httpsjms` services use different configuration
properties, described in link:http_https-support.html#aeopb[HTTP/HTTPS
Support]). Static ports are generally used only in special situations,
however, such as in making connections through a firewall (see
link:security-services.html#gcuhq[Connecting Through a Firewall]), and
are not recommended for general use.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In cases where two or more hosts are available (such as when more than
one network interface card is installed in a computer), you can use
broker properties to specify which host the connection services should
bind to. The `imq.hostname` property designates a single default host
for all connection services; this can then be overridden, if necessary,
with `imq`.serviceName. protocolType.`hostname` (for the `jms`,
`ssljms`, `admin`, or `ssl`admin service) or `imq.portmapper.hostname`
(for the Port Mapper itself).

=======================================================================


When multiple Port Mapper requests are received concurrently, they are
stored in an operating system backlog while awaiting action. The
`imq.portmapper.backlog` property specifies the maximum number of such
backlogged requests. When this limit is exceeded, any further requests
will be rejected until the backlog is reduced.

[[aeocp]][[GMADG00527]][[thread-pool-management]]

Thread Pool Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each connection service is multithreaded, supporting multiple
connections. The threads needed for these connections are maintained by
the broker in a separate thread pool for each service. As threads are
needed by a connection, they are added to the thread pool for the
service supporting that connection.

The threading model you choose specifies whether threads are dedicated
to a single connection or shared by multiple connections:

* In the dedicated model, each connection to the broker requires two
threads: one for incoming and one for outgoing messages. This limits the
number of connections that can be supported, but provides higher
performance.
* In the shared model, connections are processed by a shared thread when
sending or receiving messages. Because each connection does not require
dedicated threads, this model increases the number of possible
connections, but at the cost of lower performance because of the
additional overhead needed for thread management.

The broker's `imq`.serviceName. `threadpool_model` property specifies
which of the two models to use for a given connection service. This
property takes either of two string values: `dedicated` or `shared`. If
you don't set the property explicitly, `dedicated` is assumed by
default.

You can also set the broker properties `imq`.serviceName. `min_threads`
and `imq`.serviceName. `max_threads` to specify a minimum and maximum
number of threads in a service's thread pool. When the number of
available threads exceeds the specified minimum threshold, Message Queue
will shut down threads as they become free until the minimum is reached
again, thereby saving on memory resources. Under heavy loads, the number
of threads might increase until the pool's maximum number is reached; at
this point, new connections are rejected until a thread becomes
available.

The shared threading model uses distributor threads to assign threads to
active connections. The broker property
`imq.shared.connectionMonitor_limit` specifies the maximum number of
connections that can be monitored by a single distributor thread. The
smaller the value of this property, the faster threads can be assigned
to connections. The `imq.ping.interval` property specifies the time
interval, in seconds, at which the broker will periodically test
("ping") a connection to verify that it is still active, allowing
connection failures to be detected preemptively before an attempted
message transmission fails.

[[aeoed]][[GMADG00236]][[managing-connection-services]]

Managing Connection Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue brokers support connections from both application clients
and administrative clients. See link:#aeocn[Configuring Connection
Services] for a description of the available connection services. The
Command utility provides subcommands that you can use for managing both
connection services as a whole and individual services; to apply a
subcommand to a particular service, use the `-n` option to specify one
of the names listed in the "Service Name" column of link:#gbnjw[Table
6-1]. Subcommands are available for the following connection service
management tasks:

* link:#aeoei[Pausing and Resuming a Connection Service]
* link:#aeoeg[Updating Connection Service Properties]
* link:#aeoee[Viewing Connection Service Information]

[[aeoei]][[GMADG00528]][[pausing-and-resuming-a-connection-service]]

Pausing and Resuming a Connection Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pausing a connection service has the following effects:

* The broker stops accepting new client connections on the paused
service. If a Message Queue client attempts to open a new connection, it
will get an exception.
* All existing connections on the paused service are kept alive, but the
broker suspends all message processing on such connections until the
service is resumed. (For example, if a client attempts to send a
message, the `send` method will block until the service is resumed.)
* The message delivery state of any messages already received by the
broker is maintained. (For example, transactions are not disrupted and
message delivery will resume when the service is resumed.)

The `admin` connection service can never be paused; to pause and resume
any other service, use the subcommands `imqcmd` `pause` `svc` and
`imqcmd` `resume` `svc`. The syntax of the `imqcmd` `pause` `svc`
subcommand is as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause svc   -n serviceName
                     [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command pauses the `httpjms` service running
on the default broker (host `localhost` at port `7676`):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause svc  -n httpjms  -u admin
----

The `imqcmd` `resume` `svc` subcommand resumes operation of a connection
service following a pause:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume svc   -n serviceName
                      [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

[[aeoeg]][[GMADG00529]][[updating-connection-service-properties]]

Updating Connection Service Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the `imqcmd` `update` `svc` subcommand to change the value
of one or more of the service properties listed in link:#gbnjt[Table
6-2]. See link:broker-properties.html#aeont[Connection Properties] for a
description of these properties.

[[GMADG649]][[sthref21]][[gbnjt]]


Table 6-2 Connection Service Properties Updated by Command Utility

[width="100%",cols="17%,83%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Description
|`port` a|
Port assigned to the service to be updated (does not apply to `httpjms`
or `httpsjms`)

A value of `0` means the port is dynamically allocated by the Port
Mapper.

|`minThreads` |Minimum number of threads assigned to the service

|`maxThreads` |Maximum number of threads assigned to the service
|=======================================================================


The `imqcmd` `update` `svc` subcommand has the following syntax:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update svc   -n serviceName
                      [-b hostName:portNumber]
 -o property1=value1  [[-o property2=value2]…]
----

For example, the following command changes the minimum number of threads
assigned to the `jms` connection service on the default broker (host
`localhost` at port `7676`) to 20:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update svc  -o minThreads=20  -u admin
----

[[aeoee]][[GMADG00530]][[viewing-connection-service-information]]

Viewing Connection Service Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To list the connection services available on a broker, use the `imqcmd`
`list` `svc` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command lists all services on the default
broker (host `localhost` at port `7676`):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc  -u admin 
----

link:#genpd[Example 6-1] shows an example of the resulting output.

single connection service:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query svc   -n serviceName
[-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command displays information about the `jms`

Max Number of Threads                  1000
----

To display metrics information about a connection service, use the
`imqcmd` `metrics` `svc` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics svc   -n serviceName
                       [-b hostName:portNumber]
[-m metricType]
[-int interval]
[-msp numSamples]
----

The `-m` option specifies the type of metric information to display:

* `ttl` (default): Messages and packets flowing into and out of the
broker by way of the specified connection service
* `rts`: Rate of flow of messages and packets into and out of the broker
per second by way of the specified connection service
* `cxn`: Connections, virtual memory heap, and threads

The `-int` and `-msp` options specify, respectively, the interval (in
seconds) at which to display the metrics and the number of samples to
display in the output. The default values are 5 seconds and an unlimited
number of samples.

For example, the following command displays cumulative totals for
messages and packets handled by the default broker (host `localhost` at
port `7676`) by way of the `jms` connection service:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics svc  -n jms  -m ttl  -u admin

Managing Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Command utility's `list` `cxn` and `query` `cxn` subcommands display
information about individual connections. The subcommand `imqcmd` `list`
`cxn` lists all connections for a specified connection service:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list cxn  [-svn serviceName]
[-b hostName:portNumber]
----

If no service name is specified, all connections are listed. For
example, the following command lists all connections on the default
broker (host `localhost` at port `7676`):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list cxn  -u admin 
----
