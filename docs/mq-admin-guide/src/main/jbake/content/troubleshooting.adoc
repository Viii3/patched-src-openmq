15 Troubleshooting
------------------

This chapter explains how to understand and resolve the following
problems:

* link:#aeole[A Client Cannot Establish a Connection]
* link:#aeoln[Connection Throughput Is Too Slow]
* link:#aeolt[A Client Cannot Create a Message Producer]
* link:#aeolw[Message Production Is Delayed or Slowed]
* link:#aeomb[Messages Are Backlogged]
* link:#aeomi[Broker Throughput Is Sporadic]
* link:#aeomm[Messages Are Not Reaching Consumers]
* link:#aeomr[Dead Message Queue Contains Messages]

When problems occur, it is useful to check the version number of the
installed Message Queue software. Use the version number to ensure that
you are using documentation whose version matches the software version.
You also need the version number to report a problem to Oracle. To check
the version number, issue the following command:

`imqcmd` `-v`

[[aeole]][[GMADG00271]][[a-client-cannot-establish-a-connection]]

A Client Cannot Establish a Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptoms:

* Client cannot make a new connection.
* Client cannot auto-reconnect on failed connection.

Possible causes:

* link:#gbnuq[Client applications are not closing connections, causing
the number of connections to exceed resource limitations.]
* link:#aeolg[Broker is not running or there is a network connectivity
problem.]
* link:#aeolh[Connection service is inactive or paused.]
* link:#aeoli[Too few threads available for the number of connections
required.]
* link:#aeolj[Too few file descriptors for the number of connections
required on the Solaris or Linux platform.]
* link:#aeolk[TCP backlog limits the number of simultaneous new
connection requests that can be established.]
* link:#aeoll[Operating system limits the number of concurrent
connections.].
* link:#aeolm[Authentication or authorization of the user is failing.]

[[gbnuq]][[GMADG699]]

Client applications are not closing connections, causing the number of
connections to exceed resource limitations.

To confirm this cause of the problem: List all connections to a broker:

`imqcmd list cxn`

The output will list all connections and the host from which each
connection has been made, revealing an unusual number of open
connections for specific clients.

To resolve the problem: Rewrite the offending clients to close unused
connections.

[[aeolg]][[GMADG700]]

Broker is not running or there is a network connectivity problem.

To confirm this cause of the problem:

* Telnet to the broker's primary port (for example, the default of
`7676`) and verify that the broker responds with Port Mapper output.
* Verify that the broker process is running on the host.

To resolve the problem:

* Start up the broker.
* Fix the network connectivity problem.

[[aeolh]][[GMADG701]]

Connection service is inactive or paused.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check the status of all connection
services:

`imqcmd list svc`

If the status of a connection service is shown as `unknown` or `paused`,
clients will not be able to establish a connection using that service.

To resolve the problem:

* If the status of a connection service is shown as `unknown` , it is
missing from the active service list (`imq.service.active` ). In the
case of SSL-based services, the service might also be improperly
configured, causing the broker to make the following entry in the broker
log: +
`ERROR [B3009]: Unable to start service ssljms:``[B4001]: Unable to open protocol tls for ssljms service...` +
followed by an explanation of the underlying cause of the exception. +
To properly configure SSL services, see
link:security-services.html#aeogb[Message Encryption].
* If the status of a connection service is shown as `paused`, resume the
service (see link:connection-services.html#aeoei[Pausing and Resuming a
Connection Service]).

[[aeoli]][[GMADG702]]

Too few threads available for the number of connections required.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check for the following entry in
the broker log:

`WARNING [B3004]: No threads are available to process a new connection on service ...``Closing the new connection.`

Also check the number of connections on the connection service and the
number of threads currently in use, using one of the following formats:

`imqcmd query svc` `-n` serviceName`imqcmd metrics svc` `-n`
serviceName`-m cxn`

Each connection requires two threads: one for incoming messages and one
for outgoing messages (see link:connection-services.html#aeocp[Thread
Pool Management]).

To resolve the problem:

* If you are using a dedicated thread pool model
(`imq.`serviceName`.threadpool_model=``dedicated`), the maximum number
of connections is half the maximum number of threads in the thread pool.
Therefore, to increase the number of connections, increase the size of
the thread pool (`imq.`serviceName`.max_threads`) or switch to the
shared thread pool model.
* If you are using a shared thread pool model
(`imq.`serviceName`.threadpool_model=shared`), the maximum number of
connections is half the product of the connection monitor limit
(`imq.`serviceName`.connectionMonitor_limit`) and the maximum number of
threads (`imq.`serviceName`.max_threads`). Therefore, to increase the
number of connections, increase the size of the thread pool or increase
the connection monitor limit.
* Ultimately, the number of supportable connections (or the throughput
on connections) will reach input/output limits. In such cases, use a
multiple-broker cluster to distribute connections among the broker
instances within the cluster.

[[aeolj]][[GMADG703]]

Too few file descriptors for the number of connections required on the
Solaris or Linux platform.

For more information about this issue, see
link:starting-brokers-and-clients.html#aeobx[Setting the File Descriptor
Limit].

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check for an entry in the broker
log similar to the following:

`Too many open files`

To resolve the problem: Increase the file descriptor limit, as described
in the `man` page for the `ulimit` command.

[[aeolk]][[GMADG704]]

TCP backlog limits the number of simultaneous new connection requests
that can be established.

The TCP backlog places a limit on the number of simultaneous connection
requests that can be stored in the system backlog
(`imq.portmapper.backlog`) before the Port Mapper rejects additional
requests. (On the Windows platform there is a hard-coded backlog limit
of 5 for Windows desktops and 200 for Windows servers.)

The rejection of requests because of backlog limits is usually a
transient phenomenon, due to an unusually high number of simultaneous
connection requests.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Examine the broker log. First,
check to see whether the broker is accepting some connections during the
same time period that it is rejecting others. Next, check for messages
that explain rejected connections. If you find such messages, the TCP
backlog is probably not the problem, because the broker does not log
connection rejections due to the TCP backlog. If some successful
connections are logged, and no connection rejections are logged, the TCP
backlog is probably the problem.

To resolve the problem:

* Program the client to retry the attempted connection after a short
interval of time (this normally works because of the transient nature of
this problem).
* Increase the value of `imq.portmapper.backlog`.
* Check that clients are not closing and then opening connections too
often.

[[aeoll]][[GMADG705]]

Operating system limits the number of concurrent connections.

The Windows operating system license places limits on the number of
concurrent remote connections that are supported.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check that there are plenty of
threads available for connections (using `imqcmd` `query` `svc`) and
check the terms of your Windows license agreement. If you can make
connections from a local client, but not from a remote client, operating
system limitations might be the cause of the problem.

To resolve the problem:

* Upgrade the Windows license to allow more connections.
* Distribute connections among a number of broker instances by setting
up a multiple-broker cluster.

[[aeolm]][[GMADG706]]

Authentication or authorization of the user is failing.

The authentication may be failing for any of the following reasons:

* Incorrect password
* No entry for user in user repository
* User does not have access permission for connection service

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check entries in the broker log
for the `Forbidden` error message. This will indicate an authentication
error, but will not indicate the reason for it.

* If you are using a file-based user repository, enter the following
command: +
`imqusermgr list` `-i` instanceName`-u` userName +
If the output shows a user, the wrong password was probably submitted.
If the output shows the following error, there is no entry for the user
in the user repository: +
`Error [B3048]: User does not exist in the password file`
* If you are using an LDAP server user repository, use the appropriate
tools to check whether there is an entry for the user.
* Check the access control file to see whether there are restrictions on
access to the connection service.

To resolve the problem:

* If the wrong password was used, provide the correct password.
* If there is no entry for the user in the user repository, add one (see
link:security-services.html#gewbc[Adding a User to the Repository]).
* If the user does not have access permission for the connection
service, edit the access control file to grant such permission (see
link:security-services.html#aeofy[Authorization Rules for Connection
Services]).

[[aeoln]][[GMADG00272]][[connection-throughput-is-too-slow]]

Connection Throughput Is Too Slow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptoms:

* Message throughput does not meet expectations.
* Message input/output rates are not limited by an insufficient number
of supported connections (as described in link:#aeole[A Client Cannot
Establish a Connection]).

Possible causes:

* link:#aeolo[Network connection or WAN is too slow.]
* link:#aeolp[Connection service protocol is inherently slow compared to
TCP.]
* link:#aeolq[Connection service protocol is not optimally tuned.]
* link:#aeolr[Messages are so large that they consume too much
bandwidth.]
* link:#aeols[What appears to be slow connection throughput is actually
a bottleneck in some other step of the message delivery process.]

[[aeolo]][[GMADG707]]

Network connection or WAN is too slow.

To confirm this cause of the problem:

* Ping the network, to see how long it takes for the ping to return, and
consult a network administrator.
* Send and receive messages using local clients and compare the delivery
time with that of remote clients (which use a network link).

To resolve the problem: Upgrade the network link.

[[aeolp]][[GMADG708]]

Connection service protocol is inherently slow compared to TCP.

For example, SSL-based or HTTP-based protocols are slower than TCP (see
link:tuning.html#aeokb[Transport Protocols]).

To confirm this cause of the problem: If you are using SSL-based or
HTTP-based protocols, try using TCP and compare the delivery times.

To resolve the problem: Application requirements usually dictate the
protocols being used, so there is little you can do other than attempt
to tune the protocol as described in link:tuning.html#aeoko[Tuning
Transport Protocols].

[[aeolq]][[GMADG709]]

Connection service protocol is not optimally tuned.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Try tuning the protocol to see
whether it makes a difference.

To resolve the problem: Try tuning the protocol, as described in
link:tuning.html#aeoko[Tuning Transport Protocols].

[[aeolr]][[GMADG710]]

Messages are so large that they consume too much bandwidth.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Try running your benchmark with
smaller-sized messages.

To resolve the problem:

* Have application developers modify the application to use the message
compression feature, which is described in the Open Message Queue
Developer's Guide for Java Clients.
* Use messages as notifications of data to be sent, but move the data
using another protocol.

[[aeols]][[GMADG711]]

What appears to be slow connection throughput is actually a bottleneck
in some other step of the message delivery process.

To confirm this cause of the problem: If what appears to be slow
connection throughput cannot be explained by any of the causes above,
see link:tuning.html#aeojm[Factors Affecting Performance] for other
possible bottlenecks and check for symptoms associated with the
following problems:

* link:#aeolw[Message Production Is Delayed or Slowed]
* link:#aeomb[Messages Are Backlogged]
* link:#aeomi[Broker Throughput Is Sporadic]

To resolve the problem: Follow the problem resolution guidelines
provided in the troubleshooting sections listed above.

[[aeolt]][[GMADG00273]][[a-client-cannot-create-a-message-producer]]

A Client Cannot Create a Message Producer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptom:

* A message producer cannot be created for a physical destination; the
client receives an exception.

Possible causes:

* link:#aeolu[A physical destination has been configured to allow only a
limited number of producers.]
* link:#aeolv[The user is not authorized to create a message producer
due to settings in the access control file.]

[[aeolu]][[GMADG712]]

A physical destination has been configured to allow only a limited
number of producers.

One of the ways of avoiding the accumulation of messages on a physical
destination is to limit the number of producers (`maxNumProducers`) that
it supports.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check the physical destination:

`imqcmd query dst`

(see link:message-delivery.html#aeoer[Viewing Physical Destination
Information]). The output will show the current number of producers and
the value of `maxNumProducers`. If the two values are the same, the
number of producers has reached its configured limit. When a new
producer is rejected by the broker, the broker returns the exception

`ResourceAllocationException [C4088]: A JMS destination limit was reached`

and makes the following entry in the broker log:

`[B4183]: Producer can not be added to destination`

To resolve the problem: Increase the value of the `maxNumProducers`
property (see link:message-delivery.html#aeoes[Updating Physical
Destination Properties]).

[[aeolv]][[GMADG713]]

The user is not authorized to create a message producer due to settings
in the access control file.

To confirm this cause of the problem: When a new producer is rejected by
the broker, the broker returns the exception

`JMSSecurityException [C4076]: Client does not have permission to create producer on destination`

and makes the following entries in the broker log:

`[B2041]: Producer on destination denied``[B4051]: Forbidden guest`.

To resolve the problem: Change the access control properties to allow
the user to produce messages (see
link:security-services.html#aeofz[Authorization Rules for Physical
Destinations]).

[[aeolw]][[GMADG00274]][[message-production-is-delayed-or-slowed]]

Message Production Is Delayed or Slowed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptoms:

* When sending persistent messages, the `send` method does not return
and the client blocks.
* When sending a persistent message, the client receives an exception.
* A producing client slows down.

Possible causes:

* link:#aeolx[The broker is backlogged and has responded by slowing
message producers.]
* link:#aeoly[The broker cannot save a persistent message to the data
store.]
* link:#aeolz[Broker acknowledgment timeout is too short.]
* link:#aeoma[A producing client is encountering JVM limitations.]

[[aeolx]][[GMADG714]]

The broker is backlogged and has responded by slowing message producers.

A backlogged broker accumulates messages in broker memory. When the
number of messages or message bytes in physical destination memory
reaches configured limits, the broker attempts to conserve memory
resources in accordance with the specified limit behavior. The following
limit behaviors slow down message producers:

* `FLOW_CONTROL`: The broker does not immediately acknowledge receipt of
persistent messages (thereby blocking a producing client).
* `REJECT_NEWEST`: The broker rejects new persistent messages.

Similarly, when the number of messages or message bytes in brokerwide
memory (for all physical destinations) reaches configured limits, the
broker will attempt to conserve memory resources by rejecting the newest
messages. Also, when system memory limits are reached because physical
destination or brokerwide limits have not been set properly, the broker
takes increasingly serious action to prevent memory overload. These
actions include throttling back message producers.

To confirm this cause of the problem: When a message is rejected by the
broker because of configured message limits, the broker returns the
exception

`JMSException [C4036]: A server error occurred`

and makes the following entry in the broker log:

`[B2011]: Storing of JMS message from IMQconn failed`

This message is followed by another indicating the limit that has been
reached:

`[B4120]: Cannot store message on destination`
destName`because capacity of` maxNumMsgs`would be exceeded.`

if the exceeded message limit is on a physical destination, or

`[B4024]: The maximum number of messages currrently in the system has been exceeded, rejecting message.`

if the limit is brokerwide.

More generally, you can check for message limit conditions before the
rejections occur as follows:

* Query physical destinations and the broker and inspect their
configured message limit settings.
* Monitor the number of messages or message bytes currently in a
physical destination or in the broker as a whole, using the appropriate
`imqcmd` commands. See link:metrics-information.html#aeoor[Metrics
Information Reference] for information about metrics you can monitor and
the commands you use to obtain them.

To resolve the problem:

* Modify the message limits on a physical destination (or brokerwide),
being careful not to exceed memory resources. +
In general, you should manage memory at the individual destination
level, so that brokerwide message limits are never reached. For more
information, see link:tuning.html#aeokt[Broker Memory Management
Adjustments].
* Change the limit behaviors on a destination so as not to slow message
production when message limits are reached, but rather to discard
messages in memory. +
For example, you can specify the `REMOVE_OLDEST` and
`REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY` limit behaviors, which delete messages that
accumulate in memory (see
link:physical-destination-properties.html#gbnne[Table 18-1]).

[[aeoly]][[GMADG715]]

The broker cannot save a persistent message to the data store.

If the broker cannot access a data store or write a persistent message
to it, the producing client is blocked. This condition can also occur if
destination or brokerwide message limits are reached, as described
above.

To confirm this cause of the problem: If the broker is unable to write
to the data store, it makes one of the following entries in the broker
log:

`[B2011]: Storing of JMS message from`
connectionID`failed``[B4004]: Failed to persist message` messageID

To resolve the problem:

* In the case of file-based persistence, try increasing the disk space
of the file-based data store.
* In the case of a JDBC-compliant data store, check that JDBC-based
persistence is properly configured
(seelink:persistence-services.html#aeodi[Configuring a JDBC-Based Data
Store]). If so, consult your database administrator to troubleshoot
other database problems.

[[aeolz]][[GMADG716]]

Broker acknowledgment timeout is too short.

Because of slow connections or a lethargic broker (caused by high CPU
utilization or scarce memory resources), a broker may require more time
to acknowledge receipt of a persistent message than allowed by the value
of the connection factory's `imqAckTimeout` attribute.

To confirm this cause of the problem: If the `imqAckTimeout` value is
exceeded, the broker returns the exception

`JMSException [C4000]: Packet acknowledge failed`

To resolve the problem: Change the value of the `imqAckTimeout`
connection factory attribute (see
link:administered-objects.html#aeohh[Reliability And Flow Control]).

[[aeoma]][[GMADG717]]

A producing client is encountering JVM limitations.

To confirm this cause of the problem:

* Find out whether the client application receives an out-of-memory
error.
* Check the free memory available in the JVM heap, using runtime methods
such as `freeMemory`, `maxMemory`, and `totalMemory`.

To resolve the problem: Adjust the JVM (see link:tuning.html#aeokn[Java
Virtual Machine Adjustments]).

[[aeomb]][[GMADG00275]][[messages-are-backlogged]]

Messages Are Backlogged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptoms:

* Message production is delayed or produced messages are rejected by the
broker.
* Messages take an unusually long time to reach consumers.
* The number of messages or message bytes in the broker (or in specific
destinations) increases steadily over time.

To see whether messages are accumulating, check how the number of
messages or message bytes in the broker changes over time and compare to
configured limits. First check the configured limits:

`imqcmd query bkr`


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `imqcmd` `metrics` `bkr` subcommand does not display this
information.

=======================================================================


Then check for message accumulation in each destination:

`imqcmd list dst`

To see whether messages have exceeded configured destination or
brokerwide limits, check the broker log for the entry

`[B2011]: Storing of JMS message from` …`failed.`

This entry will be followed by another identifying the limit that has
been exceeded.

Possible causes:

* link:#aeomc[There are inactive durable subscriptions on a topic
destination.]
* link:#aeomd[Too few consumers are available to consume messages in a
multiple-consumer queue.]
* link:#aeome[Message consumers are processing too slowly to keep up
with message producers.]
* link:#aeomf[Client acknowledgment processing is slowing down message
consumption.]
* link:#aeomg[The broker cannot keep up with produced messages.]
* link:#aeomh[Client code defects; consumers are not acknowledging
messages.]

[[aeomc]][[GMADG718]]

There are inactive durable subscriptions on a topic destination.

If a durable subscription is inactive, messages are stored in a
destination until the corresponding consumer becomes active and can
consume the messages.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check the state of durable
subscriptions on each topic destination:

`imqcmd list dur` `-d` destName

To resolve the problem:

* Purge all messages for the offending durable subscriptions (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoek[Managing Durable Subscriptions]).
* Specify message limit and limit behavior attributes for the topic (see
link:physical-destination-properties.html#gbnne[Table 18-1]). For
example, you can specify the `REMOVE_OLDEST` and `REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY`
limit behaviors, which delete messages that accumulate in memory.
* Purge all messages from the corresponding destinations (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoeu[Purging a Physical Destination]).
* Limit the time messages can remain in memory by rewriting the
producing client to set a time-to-live value on each message. You can
override any such settings for all producers sharing a connection by
setting the `imqOverrideJMSExpiration` and `imqJMSExpiration` connection
factory attributes (see
link:administered-object-attributes.html#aeook[Message Header
Overrides]).

[[aeomd]][[GMADG719]]

Too few consumers are available to consume messages in a
multiple-consumer queue.

If there are too few active consumers to which messages can be
delivered, a queue destination can become backlogged as messages
accumulate. This condition can occur for any of the following reasons:

* Too few active consumers exist for the destination.
* Consuming clients have failed to establish connections.
* No active consumers use a selector that matches messages in the queue.

To confirm this cause of the problem: To help determine the reason for
unavailable consumers, check the number of active consumers on a
destination:

`imqcmd metrics dst` `-n` destName`-t q` `-m con`

To resolve the problem: Depending on the reason for unavailable
consumers,

* Create more active consumers for the queue by starting up additional
consuming clients.
* Adjust the `imq.consumerFlowLimit` broker property to optimize queue
delivery to multiple consumers (see link:tuning.html#aeokx[Adjusting
Multiple-Consumer Queue Delivery]).
* Specify message limit and limit behavior attributes for the queue (see
link:physical-destination-properties.html#gbnne[Table 18-1]). For
example, you can specify the `REMOVE_OLDEST` and `REMOVE_LOW_PRIOROTY`
limit behaviors, which delete messages that accumulate in memory.
* Purge all messages from the corresponding destinations (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoeu[Purging a Physical Destination]).
* Limit the time messages can remain in memory by rewriting the
producing client to set a time-to-live value on each message. You can
override any such setting for all producers sharing a connection by
setting the `imqOverrideJMSExpiration` and `imqJMSExpiration` connection
factory attributes (see
link:administered-object-attributes.html#aeook[Message Header
Overrides]).

[[aeome]][[GMADG720]]

Message consumers are processing too slowly to keep up with message
producers.

In this case, topic subscribers or queue receivers are consuming
messages more slowly than the producers are sending messages. One or
more destinations are getting backlogged with messages because of this
imbalance.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check for the rate of flow of
messages into and out of the broker:

`imqcmd metrics bkr` `-m rts`

Then check flow rates for each of the individual destinations:

`imqcmd metrics bkr` `-t` destType`-n` destName`-m rts`

To resolve the problem:

* Optimize consuming client code.
* For queue destinations, increase the number of active consumers (see
link:tuning.html#aeokx[Adjusting Multiple-Consumer Queue Delivery]).

[[aeomf]][[GMADG721]]

Client acknowledgment processing is slowing down message consumption.

Two factors affect the processing of client acknowledgments:

* Significant broker resources can be consumed in processing client
acknowledgments. As a result, message consumption may be slowed in those
acknowledgment modes in which consuming clients block until the broker
confirms client acknowledgments.
* JMS payload messages and Message Queue control messages (such as
client acknowledgments) share the same connection. As a result, control
messages can be held up by JMS payload messages, slowing message
consumption.

To confirm this cause of the problem:

* Check the flow of messages relative to the flow of packets. If the
number of packets per second is out of proportion to the number of
messages, client acknowledgments may be a problem.
* Check to see whether the client has received the following exception: +
`JMSException [C4000]: Packet acknowledge failed`

To resolve the problem:

* Modify the acknowledgment mode used by clients: for example, switch to
`DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE` or `CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`.
* If using `CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` or transacted sessions, group a larger
number of messages into a single acknowledgment.
* Adjust consumer and connection flow control parameters (see
link:tuning.html#aeoky[Client Runtime Message Flow Adjustments] ).

[[aeomg]][[GMADG722]]

The broker cannot keep up with produced messages.

In this case, messages are flowing into the broker faster than the
broker can route and dispatch them to consumers. The sluggishness of the
broker can be due to limitations in any or all of the following:

* CPU
* Network socket read/write operations
* Disk read/write operations
* Memory paging
* Persistent store
* JVM memory limits

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check that none of the other
possible causes of this problem are responsible.

To resolve the problem:

* Upgrade the speed of your computer or data store.
* Use a broker cluster to distribute the load among multiple broker
instances.

[[aeomh]][[GMADG723]]

Client code defects; consumers are not acknowledging messages.

Messages are held in a destination until they have been acknowledged by
all consumers to which they have been sent. If a client is not
acknowledging consumed messages, the messages accumulate in the
destination without being deleted.

For example, client code might have the following defects:

* Consumers using the `CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` acknowledgment mode or
transacted session may not be calling `Session.acknowledge` or
`Session.commit` regularly.
* Consumers using the `AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE` acknowledgment mode may be
hanging for some reason.

To confirm this cause of the problem: First check all other possible
causes listed in this section. Next, list the destination with the
following command:

`imqcmd list dst`

Notice whether the number of messages listed under the `UnAcked` header
is the same as the number of messages in the destination. Messages under
this header were sent to consumers but not acknowledged. If this number
is the same as the total number of messages, then the broker has sent
all the messages and is waiting for acknowledgment.

To resolve the problem: Request the help of application developers in
debugging this problem.

[[aeomi]][[GMADG00276]][[broker-throughput-is-sporadic]]

Broker Throughput Is Sporadic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptom:

* Message throughput sporadically drops and then resumes normal
performance.
* Message throughput sporadically drops and then broker exits.

Possible causes:

* link:#aeomj[The broker is very low on memory resources.]
* link:#aeomk[JVM memory reclamation (garbage collection) is taking
place.]
* link:#aeoml[The JVM is using the just-in-time compiler to speed up
performance.]
* link:#BABEIBDB[The Broker exits with an out of memory exception.]

[[aeomj]][[GMADG724]]

The broker is very low on memory resources.

Because destination and broker limits were not properly set, the broker
takes increasingly serious action to prevent memory overload; this can
cause the broker to become sluggish until the message backlog is
cleared.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check the broker log for a low
memory condition

`[B1089]: In low memory condition, broker is attempting to free up resources`

followed by an entry describing the new memory state and the amount of
total memory being used. Also check the free memory available in the JVM
heap:

`imqcmd metrics bkr` `-m cxn`

Free memory is low when the value of total JVM memory is close to the
maximum JVM memory value.

To resolve the problem:

* Adjust the JVM (see link:tuning.html#aeokn[Java Virtual Machine
Adjustments]).
* Increase system swap space.

[[aeomk]][[GMADG725]]

JVM memory reclamation (garbage collection) is taking place.

Memory reclamation periodically sweeps through the system to free up
memory. When this occurs, all threads are blocked. The larger the amount
of memory to be freed up and the larger the JVM heap size, the longer
the delay due to memory reclamation.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Monitor CPU usage on your
computer. CPU usage drops when memory reclamation is taking place.

Also start your broker using the following command line options:

`-vmargs``-verbose:gc`

Standard output indicates the time when memory reclamation takes place.

To resolve the problem: In computers with multiple CPUs, set the memory
reclamation to take place in parallel:

`-XX:+UseParallelGC=true`

[[aeoml]][[GMADG726]]

The JVM is using the just-in-time compiler to speed up performance.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check that none of the other
possible causes of this problem are responsible.

To resolve the problem: Let the system run for awhile; performance

Messages Are Not Reaching Consumers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptom:

* Messages sent by producers are not received by consumers.

Possible causes:

* link:#aeomn[Limit behaviors are causing messages to be deleted on the
broker.]
* link:#aeomo[Message timeout value is expiring.]
* link:#ggxfl[The broker clock and producer clock are not synchronized.]
* link:#aeomq[Consuming client failed to start message delivery on a
connection.]

[[aeomn]][[GMADG728]]

Limit behaviors are causing messages to be deleted on the broker.

When the number of messages or message bytes in destination memory reach
configured limits, the broker attempts to conserve memory resources.
Three of the configurable behaviors adopted by the broker when these
limits are reached will cause messages to be lost:

* `REMOVE_OLDEST`: Delete the oldest messages.
* `REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY`: Delete the lowest-priority messages according
to age.
* `REJECT_NEWEST`: Reject new persistent messages.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To
Inspect the Dead Message Queue]).

Check whether the `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON` property of messages
in the queue has the value `REMOVE_OLDEST` or `REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY`.

To resolve the problem: Increase the destination limits. For example:

`imqcmd update dst` `-n MyDest``-o maxNumMsgs=1000`

[[aeomo]][[GMADG729]]

Message timeout value is expiring.

The broker deletes messages whose timeout value has expired. If a
destination gets sufficiently backlogged with messages, messages whose
time-to-live value is too short might be deleted.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To
Inspect the Dead Message Queue]).

Check whether the `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON` property of messages
in the queue has the value `EXPIRED`.

To resolve the problem: Contact the application developers and have them
increase the time-to-live value.

[[ggxfl]][[GMADG730]]

The broker clock and producer clock are not synchronized.

If clocks are not synchronized, broker calculations of message lifetimes
can be wrong, causing messages to exceed their expiration times and be
deleted.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To
Inspect the Dead Message Queue]).

Check whether the `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON` property of messages
in the queue has the value `EXPIRED`.

In the broker log file, look for any of the following messages: `B2102`,
`B2103`, `B2104`. These messages all report that possible clock skew was
detected.

To resolve the problem: Check that you are running a time
synchronization program, as described in
link:starting-brokers-and-clients.html#aeobv[Preparing System Resources].

[[aeomq]][[GMADG731]]

Consuming client failed to start message delivery on a connection.

Messages cannot be delivered until client code establishes a connection
and starts message delivery on the connection.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check that client code establishes
a connection and starts message delivery.

To resolve the problem: Rewrite the client code to establish a
connection and start message delivery.

The number of messages, or their sizes, exceed destination limits.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To

Check the values for the following message properties:

* `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON`
* `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_COMMENT`
* `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_TIMESTAMP`

Under `JMS` `Headers`, scroll down to the value for `JMSDestination` to
determine the destination whose messages are becoming dead.

To resolve the problem: Increase the destination limits. For example:

`imqcmd update dst` `-n MyDest` `-o maxNumMsgs=1000`

[[aeomu]][[GMADG735]]

Consumers are not consuming messages before they time out.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To
Inspect the Dead Message Queue]).

Check whether the `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON` property of messages
in the queue has the value `EXPIRED`.

Check to see if there any consumers on the destination and the value for
the `Current Number of Active Consumers`. For example:

`imqcmd query dst` `-t q` `-n MyDest`

If there are active consumers, then there might be any number of
possible reasons why messages are timing out before being consumed. One
is that the message timeout is too short for the speed at which the
consumer executes. In that case, request that application developers
increase message time-to-live values. Otherwise, investigate the
following possible causes for messages to time out before being
consumed:

[[aeomv]][[GMADG736]]

There are too many producers for the number of consumers.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use the QBrowser demo application
to inspect the contents of the dead message queue (see link:#ggxdi[To
Inspect the Dead Message Queue]).

Check whether the `JMS_SUN_DMQ_UNDELIVERED_REASON` property of messages
in the queue has the value `REMOVE_OLDEST` or `REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY`. If
so, use the `imqcmd` `query` `dst` command to check the number of
producers and consumers on the destination. If the number of producers
exceeds the number of consumers, the production rate might be
overwhelming the consumption rate.

To resolve the problem: Add more consumer clients or set the
destination's limit behavior to `FLOW_CONTROL` (which uses consumption
rate to control production rate), using a command such as the following:

`imqcmd update dst` `-n myDst` `-t q` `-o limitBehavior=FLOW_CONTROL`

[[aeomw]][[GMADG737]]

Producers are faster than consumers.

To confirm this cause of the problem: To determine whether slow
consumers are causing producers to slow down, set the destination's
limit behavior to `FLOW_CONTROL` (which uses consumption rate to control
production rate), using a command such as the following:

`imqcmd update dst` `-n myDst` `-t q` `-o limitBehavior=FLOW_CONTROL`

Use metrics to examine the destination's input and output, using a
command such as the following:

`imqcmd metrics dst` `-n myDst` `-t q` `-m rts`

In the metrics output, examine the following values:

* `Msgs/sec Out`: Shows how many messages per second the broker is
removing. The broker removes messages when all consumers acknowledge
receiving them, so the metric reflects consumption rate.
* `Msgs/sec In`: Shows how many messages per second the broker is
receiving from producers. The metric reflects production rate.

Because flow control aligns production to consumption, note whether
production slows or stops. If so, there is a discrepancy between the
processing speeds of producers and consumers. You can also check the
number of unacknowledged (`UnAcked`) messages sent, by using the
`imqcmd` `list` `dst` command. If the number of unacknowledged messages
is less than the size of the destination, the destination has additional
capacity and is being held back by client flow control.

To resolve the problem: If production rate is consistently faster than
consumption rate, consider using flow control regularly, to keep the
system aligned. In addition, consider and attempt to resolve each of the
following possible causes, which are subsequently described in more
detail:

* link:#aeomx[A consumer is too slow.].
* link:#aeomy[Clients are not committing transactions.].
* link:#aeomz[Consumers are failing to acknowledge messages.].
* link:#aeona[Durable subscribers are inactive.].
* link:#aeonb[An unexpected broker error has occurred.].

[[aeomx]][[GMADG738]]

A consumer is too slow.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Use `imqcmd metrics` to determine
the rate of production and consumption, as described above under
link:#aeomw[Producers are faster than consumers.].

To resolve the problem:

* Set the destinations' limit behavior to `FLOW_CONTROL`, using a
command such as the following: +
`imqcmd update dst` `-n myDst` `-t q` `-o limitBehaviort=FLOW_CONTROL` +
Use of flow control slows production to the rate of consumption and
prevents the accumulation of messages in the destination. Producer
applications hold messages until the destination can process them, with
less risk of expiration.
* Find out from application developers whether producers send messages
at a steady rate or in periodic bursts. If an application sends bursts
of messages, increase destination limits as described in the next item.
* Increase destination limits based on number of messages or bytes, or
both. To change the number of messages on a destination, enter a command
with the following format: +
`imqcmd update dst` `-n` destName`-t {q|t}` `-o maxNumMsgs=`number +
To change the size of a destination, enter a command with the following
format: +
`imqcmd update dst` `-n` destName`-t {q|t}` `-o maxTotalMsgBytes=`number +
Be aware that raising limits increases the amount of memory that the
broker uses. If limits are too high, the broker could run out of memory
and become unable to process messages.
* Consider whether you can accept loss of messages during periods of
high production load.

[[aeomy]][[GMADG739]]

Clients are not committing transactions.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Check with application developers
to find out whether the application uses transactions. If so, list the
active transactions as follows:

`imqcmd list txn`

Here is an example of the command output:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Transaction ID       State    User name  # Msgs/# Acks   Creation time

----

Note the numbers of messages and number of acknowledgments. If the
number of messages is high, producers may be sending individual messages
but failing to commit transactions. Until the broker receives a commit,
it cannot route and deliver the messages for that transaction. If the
number of acknowledgments is high, consumers may be sending
acknowledgments for individual messages but failing to commit
transactions. Until the broker receives a commit, it cannot remove the
acknowledgments for that transaction.

To resolve the problem: Contact application developers to fix the coding
error.

[[aeomz]][[GMADG740]]

Consumers are failing to acknowledge messages.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Contact application developers to
determine whether the application uses system-based acknowledgment
(`AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE` or `DUPES_ONLY`) or client-based acknowledgment
(`CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`). If the application uses system-based
acknowledgment , skip this section; if it uses client-based
acknowledgment), first decrease the number of messages stored on the
client, using a command like the following:

`imqcmd update dst` `-n myDst` `-t q` `-o consumerFlowLimit=1`

Next, you will determine whether the broker is buffering messages
because a consumer is slow, or whether the consumer processes messages
quickly but does not acknowledge them. List the destination, using the
following command:

`imqcmd list dst`

After you supply a user name and password, output like the following
appears:

The `UnAck` number represents messages that the broker has sent and for
which it is waiting for acknowledgment. If this number is high or
increasing, you know that the broker is sending messages, so it is not
waiting for a slow consumer. You also know that the consumer is not
acknowledging the messages.

To resolve the problem: Contact application developers to fix the coding
error.

Durable subscribers are inactive.

To confirm this cause of the problem: Look at the topic's durable
subscribers, using the following command format:

`imqcmd list dur` `-d` topicName

To resolve the problem:

* Purge the durable subscribers using the `imqcmd` `purge` `dur`
command.
* Restart the consumer applications.

To Inspect the Dead Message Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of troubleshooting procedures involve an inspection of the dead
message queue (`mq.sys.dmq`). The following procedure explains how to
carry out such an inspection by using the QBrowser demo application.

1.  Locate the QBrowser demo application in
`IMQ_HOME/examples/applications/qbrowser`.
2.  Run the QBrowser application: +
`java QBrowser` +
The QBrowser main window appears.
3.  Select the queue name `mq.sys.dmq` and click Browse. +
A list like the following appears: +
image:img/queuebrowsermain.png[
"QBrowser showing messages for mq.sys.dmq. For each message, there is a
number, time stamp, type, mode, and priority."]

4.  Double-click any message to display details about that message: +
The display should resemble the following: +
image:img/queuebrowsermsgdetails.png[
"Message details window. Top pane shows message; middle pane shows its
properties; bottom pane contains message."]

You can inspect the Message Properties pane to determine the reason why
the message was placed in the dead message queue.
