HTTP/HTTPS Support

C HTTP/HTTPS Support
--------------------

Message Queue includes support for Java clients to communicate with a
message broker by means of the HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) transport
protocols, rather than through a direct TCP connection. (HTTP/ HTTPS
support is not available for C clients.) Because HTTP/ HTTPS connections
are normally allowed through firewalls, this allows client applications
to be separated from the broker by a firewall.

This appendix describes the architecture used to enable HTTP/ HTTPS
support and explains the setup work needed to allow Message Queue
clients to use such connections. It has the following sections:

* link:#aeopc[HTTP/HTTPS Support Architecture]
* link:#aeopp[Enabling HTTP/HTTPS Support]
* link:#aeoqg[Troubleshooting]

[[aeopc]][[GMADG00321]][[httphttps-support-architecture]]

HTTP/HTTPS Support Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue's support architecture is very similar for both HTTP and
HTTPS support, as shown in link:#gcsbp[Figure C-1]:

* On the client side, an HTTP or HTTPS transport driver (part of the
Message Queue client runtime) encapsulates each message into an HTTP
request and makes sure that these requests are transmitted in the
correct sequence.
* If necessary, the client can use an HTTP proxy server to communicate
with the broker. The proxy's address is specified using command line
options when starting the client; seelink:#aeoqf[Using an HTTP Proxy]
for more information.
* An HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet (both bundled with Message Queue) is
loaded into an application server or Web server on the broker side and
used to pull payload messages from client HTTP requests before
forwarding them to the broker. The tunnel servlet also sends broker
messages back to the client in response to the client's HTTP requests. A
single tunnel servlet can be used to access multiple brokers.
* On the broker side, the `httpjms` or `httpsjms` connection service
unwraps and demultiplexes incoming messages from the corresponding
tunnel servlet.

messages to go through firewalls. Figure explained in text."]


The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS connections is that in the
HTTPS case (`httpsjms` connection service), the tunnel servlet has a
secure connection to both the client application and the broker. The
secure connection to the broker is established by means of the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Message Queue's SSL-enabled HTTPS tunnel
servlet passes a self-signed certificate to any broker requesting a
connection. The broker uses the certificate to establish an encrypted
connection to the tunnel servlet. Once this connection is established, a
secure connection between the client application and the tunnel servlet
can be negotiated by the client application and the application server
or Web server.

[[aeopp]][[GMADG00322]][[enabling-httphttps-support]]

Enabling HTTP/HTTPS Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The procedures for enabling HTTP and HTTPS support are essentially the
same for both protocols, although a few extra steps are required in the
HTTPS case to generate and access the needed encryption keys and
certificates. The steps are as follows. (For HTTPS, start with step 1;
for non-secure HTTP, start with step 4.)

1.  (HTTPS only) Generate a self-signed certificate for the HTTPS tunnel
servlet.
2.  (HTTPS only) Modify the deployment descriptor in the tunnel
servlet's `.war` file to specify the location and password of the
certificate key store.
3.  (HTTPS only) Validate the Web or application server's self-signed
certificate and install it in the client application's trust store.
4.  (HTTP and HTTPS) Deploy the HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet.
5.  (HTTP and HTTPS) Configure the broker's `httpjms` or `httpsjms`
connection service and start the broker.
6.  (HTTP and HTTPS) Configure an HTTP or HTTPS connection.

The following subsections describe each of these steps in greater
detail, using GlassFish Server as an example for purposes of
illustration. If you are using a different application server or Web
server (such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server), the procedures will be
substantially similar but may differ in detail; see your server
product's own documentation for specifics.

[[aeopq]][[GMADG00630]][[step-1-https-only-generating-a-self-signed-certificate-for-the-tunnel-servlet]]

Step 1 (HTTPS Only): Generating a Self-Signed Certificate for the Tunnel
Servlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue's SSL support is oriented toward securing on-the-wire
data, on the assumption that the client is communicating with a known
and trusted server. Therefore, SSL is implemented using only self-signed
server certificates. Before establishing an HTTPS connection, you must
obtain such a certificate. (This step is not needed for ordinary,
non-secure HTTP connections.)

Run the Message Queue Key Tool utility (`imqkeytool`) to generate a
self-signed certificate for the tunnel servlet. (On UNIX systems, you
may need to run the utility as the root user in order to have permission
to create the key store.) Enter the following at the command prompt:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqkeytool  -servlet keyStoreLocation
----

where keyStoreLocation is the location of Message Queue's key store
file.

The Key Tool utility prompts you for a key store password:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Enter keystore password:
----

After you have entered a valid password, the utility prompts you for
identifying information from which to construct an X.500 distinguished
name. link:#gexlf[Table C-1] shows the prompts and the values to be
provided for each prompt. Values are case-insensitive and can include
spaces.

[[GMADG817]][[sthref285]][[gexlf]]


Table C-1 Distinguished Name Information Required for a Self-Signed
Certificate

[width="100%",cols="29%,23%,28%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Prompt |X.500 Attribute |Description |Example
|`What is your first and last name?` |commonName (CN) |Fully qualified
name of server running the broker |`mqserver.sun.com`

|`What is the name of your organizational unit?` |organizationalUnit
(OU) |Name of department or division |`purchasing`

|`What is the name of your organization?` |organizationName (ON) |Name
of larger organization, such as a company or government entity
|`Acme Widgets, Inc.`

|`What is the name of your city or locality?` |localityName (L) |Name of
city or locality |`San Francisco`

|`What is the name of your state or province?` |stateName (ST) |Full
(unabbreviated) name of state or province |`California`

|`What is the two-letter country code for this unit?` |country (C)
|Standard two-letter country code |`US`
|=======================================================================


When you have entered the information, the Key Tool utility displays it
for confirmation: for example,

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
   Is CN=mqserver.sun.com, OU=purchasing, ON=Acme Widgets, Inc.,
   L=San Francisco, ST=California, C=US correct?
----

To accept the current values and proceed, enter `yes`; to reenter
values, accept the default or enter `no`. After you confirm, the utility
pauses while it generates a key pair.

Next, the utility asks for a password to lock the key pair (key
password). Press Return in response to this prompt to use the same
password for both the key password and the key store password.


[CAUTION]
=======================================================================

Be sure to remember the password you specify. You must provide this
password later to the tunnel servlet so it can open the key store.

=======================================================================


The Key Tool utility generates a self-signed certificate and places it
in Message Queue's key store file at the location you specified for the
keyStoreLocation argument.


[CAUTION]
=======================================================================

The HTTPS tunnel servlet must be able to see the key store. Be sure to
move or copy the generated key store from the location specified by
keyStoreLocation to one accessible to the tunnel servlet (see
link:#aeops[Step 4 (HTTP and HTTPS): Deploying the Tunnel Servlet]).

=======================================================================


[[aeopr]][[GMADG00631]][[step-2-https-only-specifying-the-key-store-location-and-password]]

Step 2 (HTTPS Only): Specifying the Key Store Location and Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tunnel servlet's Web archive (`.war`) file includes a deployment
descriptor, an XML file containing the basic configuration information
needed by the application server or Web server to load and run the
servlet. Before deploying the `.war` file for the HTTPS tunnel servlet,
you must edit the deployment descriptor to specify the location and
password of the certificate key store. (This step is not needed for
ordinary, non-secure HTTP connections.)

[[gbnqf]][[GMADG00202]][[to-specify-the-location-and-password-of-the-certificate-key-store]]

To Specify the Location and Password of the Certificate Key Store
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Copy the `.war` file to a temporary directory: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cp IMQ_HOME/lib/imqhttps.war /tmp
----
2.  Make the temporary directory your current directory. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd  /tmp
----
3.  Extract the contents of the `.war` file. +
[source,oac_no_warn]

jar xvf  imqhttps.war
----
4.  List the `.war` file's deployment descriptor. +
Enter the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ls  -l WEB-INF/web.xml
----
to confirm that the deployment descriptor file (`WEB-INF/web.xml`) was
successfully extracted.
5.  Edit the deployment descriptor to specify the key store location and
password. +
Edit the `web.xml` file to provide appropriate values for the
`keystoreLocation` and `keystorePassword` elements (as well as
`servletPort` and `servletHost`, if necessary): for example, +

Step 3 (HTTPS Only): Validating and Installing the Server's Self-Signed
Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for a client application to communicate with the Web or
application server, you must validate the server's self-signed
certificate and install it in the application's trust store. The
following procedure shows how:

[[gfjwc]][[GMADG00203]][[to-validate-and-install-the-servers-self-signed-certificate]]

To Validate and Install the Server's Self-Signed Certificate
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Validate the server's certificate. +
By default, the GlassFish Server generates a self-signed certificate and
stores it in a key store file at the location +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
appServerRoot/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/keystore.jks
----
where appServerRoot is the root directory in which the application
server is installed. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

If necessary, you can use the JDK Key Tool utility to generate a key
store of your own and use it in place of the default key store. For more
information, see the details about establishing a secure connection
using SSL in
"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/security-intro.html[Introduction
to Security in the Java EE Platform]" in The Java EE 7 Tutorial.

=======================================================================

1.  Make the directory containing the key store file your current
directory. +
For example, to use the Application Server's default key store file (as
shown above), navigate to its directory with the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd appServerRoot/glassfish/domains/domain1/config 
----
where appServerRoot is, again, the root directory in which the
application server is installed.
2.  List the contents of the key store file. +
The Key Tool utility's `-list` option lists the contents of a specified
key store file. For example, the following command lists the Application
Server's default key store file (`keystore.jks`): +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -list  -keystore keystore.jks  -v
----
The `-v` option tells the Key Tool utility to display certificate
fingerprints in human-readable form.
3.  Enter the key store password. +
The Key Tool utility prompts you for the key store file's password: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Enter keystore password:
----
By default, the key store password is set to `changeit`; you can use the
Key Tool utility's `-storepasswd` option to change it to something more
secure. After you have entered a valid password, the Key Tool utility
will respond with output like the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----

         Signature algorithm name: MD5withRSA
         Version: 1
----
4.  Verify the certificate's fingerprints. +
Obtain the correct fingerprints for the Application Server's self-signed
certificate by independent means (such as by telephone) and compare them
with the fingerprints displayed by the `keytool` `list` command. Do not
accept the certificate and install it in your application's trust store
unless the fingerprints match.
2.  Export the Application Server's certificate to a certificate file. +
Use the Key Tool utility's `-export` option to export the certificate
from the Application Server's key store to a separate certificate file,
from which you can then import it into your application's trust store.
For example, the following command exports the certificate shown above,
whose alias is `slas`, from the Application Server's default key store
(`keystore.jks`) to a certificate file named `slas.cer`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -export  -keystore keystore.jks  -storepass changeit
-alias slas  -file slas.cer
----
The Key Tool utility responds with the output +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Certificate stored in file <slas.cer>
----
3.  Verify the contents of the certificate file. +
If you wish, you can double-check the contents of the certificate file
to make sure it contains the correct certificate:
1.  List the contents of the certificate file. +
The Key Tool utility's `-printcert` option lists the contents of a
specified certificate file. For example, the following command lists the
certificate file `slas.cer` that was created in the preceding step: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -printcert  -file slas.cer  -v
----
Once again, the `-v` option tells the Key Tool utility to display the
certificate's fingerprints in human-readable form. The resulting output
looks like the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Owner: CN=helios, OU=Sun Java System Application Server, O=Sun Microsystems,

         Signature algorithm name: MD5withRSA
         Version: 1
----
2.  Confirm the certificate's contents. +
Examine the output from the `keytool` `printcert` command to make sure
that the certificate is correct.
4.  Import the certificate into your application's trust store. +
The Key Tool utility's `-import` option installs a certificate from a
certificate file in a specified trust store. For example, if your client
application's trust store is kept in the file
`/local/tmp/imqhttps/appKeyStore`, the following command will install
the certificate from the file `slas.cer` created above: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -file slas.cer  -keystore "/local/tmp/imqhttps/appKeyStore" 
----

[[aeops]][[GMADG00633]][[step-4-http-and-https-deploying-the-tunnel-servlet]]

Step 4 (HTTP and HTTPS): Deploying the Tunnel Servlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can deploy the HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet on GlassFish Server
either from the command line or by using the application server's
Web-based administration GUI. In either case, you must then modify the
Application Server's security policy file to grant permissions for the
tunnel servlet.

To deploy the tunnel servlet from the command line, use the `deploy`
subcommand of the application server administration utility (`asadmin`):
for example,

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin deploy  --user admin  --passwordfile pfile.txt  --force=true 
/local/tmp/imqhttps/imqhttps.war
----

The procedure below shows how to use the Web-based GUI to deploy the
servlet.

After deploying the tunnel servlet (whether from the command line or
with the Web-based GUI), proceed to link:#gfjqh[Modifying the
Application Server's Security Policy File] for instructions on how to
grant it the appropriate permissions.

[[gbnqb]][[GMADG00204]][[to-deploy-the-http-or-https-tunnel-servlet]]

To Deploy the HTTP or HTTPS Tunnel Servlet
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Deploy the tunnel servlet:
1.  In the Web-based administration GUI, choose +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
App Server>Instances>appServerInstance>Applications>Web Applications
----
where appServerInstance is the application server instance on which you
are deploying the tunnel servlet.
2.  Click the Deploy button.
2.  Specify the `.war` file location:
1.  Enter the location of the tunnel servlet's Web archive file
(`imqhttp.war` or `imqhttps.war`) in the File Path text field. +
The file is located in the `IMQ_HOME/lib` directory.
2.  Click the OK button.
3.  Specify the context root directory:
1.  Enter the `/`contextRoot portion of the tunnel servlet's URL. +
The URL has the form +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
https://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----
For example, if the URL for the tunnel servlet is +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://hostName:portNumber/imq/tunnel
----
the value you enter would be +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
/imq
----
2.  Click the OK button. +
A confirmation screen appears, showing that the tunnel servlet has been
successfully deployed and is enabled by default. The servlet is now
available at the URL +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
https://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----
where contextRoot is the context root directory you specified in step a
above. Clients can now use this URL to connect to the message service
using an HTTP or HTTPS connection.
4.  Modify the server's security policy file +
Once you have deployed the HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet, you must grant
it the appropriate permissions by modifying the Application Server's
security policy file, as described in the next procedure.

[[gfjqh]][[GMADG00205]][[modifying-the-application-servers-security-policy-file]]

Modifying the Application Server's Security Policy File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each application server instance has a security policy file specifying
its security policies or rules. Unless modified, the default security
policies would prevent the HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet from accepting
connections from the Message Queue message broker. In order for the
broker to connect to the tunnel servlet, you must add an additional
entry to this policy file:

1.  Open the security policy file. +
The file is named `server.policy` and resides at a location that varies
depending on your operating system platform. On the Solaris platform,
for example, the policy file for server `jeeves` would be located at +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
appServerRoot/glassfish/domains/domain1/jeeves/config/server.policy
----
where appServerRoot is the root directory in which GlassFish Server is
installed.
2.  Add the following entry to the file: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
grant codeBase
"file:appServerRoot/glassfish/domains/domain1/jeeves 
/applications/j2ee-modules/imqhttps/-
{  
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*","connect,accept,resolve"; 
};
----
3.  Save and close the security policy file.

[[aeopz]][[GMADG00634]][[step-5-http-and-https-configuring-the-connection-service]]

Step 5 (HTTP and HTTPS): Configuring the Connection Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HTTP/HTTPS support is not activated for a broker by default, so before
connecting using these protocols, you need to reconfigure the broker to
activate the `httpjms` or `httpsjms` connection service.
link:#geydd[Table C-2] shows broker configuration properties pertaining
specifically to these two connection services. Once reconfigured, the
broker can be started normally, as described under

[[gbnqd]][[GMADG00206]][[to-activate-the-httpjms-or-httpsjms-connection-service]]

To Activate the `httpjms` or `httpsjms` Connection Service
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Open the broker's instance configuration file. +
The instance configuration file is named `config.properties` and is
located in `IMQ_VARHOME/instances/`instanceName`/props`.
2.  Add `httpjms` or `httpsjms` to the list of active connection
services. +
Add the value `httpjms` or `httpsjms` to the `imq.service.activelist`
property: for example, +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.service.activelist=jms,admin,httpjms 
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.service.activelist=jms,admin,httpsjms 
----
3.  Set any other HTTP/HTTPS-related configuration properties as needed. +
At startup, the broker looks for an application server or Web server and
an HTTP or HTTPS tunnel servlet running on its local host machine. If
necessary, you can reconfigure the broker to access a remote tunnel
servlet instead, by setting the `servletHost` and `servletPort`
properties appropriately (see link:#geydd[Table C-2]): for example, +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.httpjms.http.servletHost=helios 
imq.httpjms.http.servletPort=7675
----
You can also improve performance by reconfiguring the connection
service's `pullPeriod` property. This specifies the interval, in
seconds, at which each client issues HTTP/HTTPS requests to pull
messages from the broker. With the default value of -1, the client will
keep one such request pending at all times, ready to pull messages as
fast as possible. With a large number of clients, this can cause a heavy
drain on server resources, causing the server to become unresponsive.
Setting the `pullPeriod` property to a positive value configures the
client's HTTP/HTTPS transport driver to wait that many seconds between
pull requests, conserving server resources at the expense of increased
response times to clients. +
The `connectionTimeout` property specifies the interval, in seconds,
that the client runtime waits for a response from the HTTP/ HTTPS tunnel
servlet before throwing an exception, as well as the time the broker
waits after communicating with the tunnel servlet before freeing a
connection. (A timeout is necessary in this case because the broker and
the tunnel servlet have no way of knowing if a client that is accessing
the tunnel servlet has terminated abnormally.)

[[aeoqa]][[GMADG00635]][[step-6-http-and-https-configuring-a-connection]]

Step 6 (HTTP and HTTPS): Configuring a Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make HTTP/HTTPS connections to a broker, a client application needs
an appropriately configured connection factory administered object.
Before configuring the connection factory, clients wishing to use secure
HTTPS connections must also have access to SSL libraries provided by the
Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) and must obtain a trusted root
certificate.

[[aeoqc]][[GMADG00475]][[installing-a-root-certificate-https-only]]

Installing a Root Certificate (HTTPS Only)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the root certificate of the certification authority (CA) that signed
your application server's (or Web server's) certificate is not in the
trust store by default, or if you are using a proprietary application
server or Web server certificate, you must install the root certificate
in the trust store. (This step is not needed for ordinary, non-secure
HTTP connections, or if the CA's root certificate is already in the
trust store by default.)

[[geygn]][[GMADG00207]][[installing-a-root-certificate-in-the-trust-store]]

Installing a Root Certificate in the Trust Store

1.  Import the root certificate. +
Execute the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]

Configuring the Connection Factory (HTTP and HTTPS)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable HTTP/HTTPS support, you need to set the connection factory's
`imqAddressList` attribute to the URL of the HTTP/HTTPS tunnel servlet.
The URL has the form

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----

or

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
https://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel
----

where hostName`:`portNumber is the host name and port number of the
application server or Web server hosting the tunnel servlet and
contextRoot is the context root directory you specified when deploying
the tunnel servlet on the server, as described above under
link:#aeops[Step 4 (HTTP and HTTPS): Deploying the Tunnel Servlet].

You can set the `imqAddressList` attribute in any of the following ways:

* Use the `-o` option to the `imqobjmgr` command that creates the
connection factory administered object (see
link:administered-objects.html#aeoho[Adding a Connection Factory]).
* Set the attribute when creating the connection factory administered
object using the Administration Console (`imqadmin`).
* Use the `-D` option to the command that launches the client
application.
* Use an API call to set the attributes of the connection factory after
you create it programmatically in client application code (see the Open
Message Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients).

Using a Single Servlet to Access Multiple Brokers (HTTP and HTTPS)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is not necessary to configure multiple application or Web servers and
tunnel servlets in order to access multiple brokers; you can share a
single server instance and tunnel servlet among them. To do this, you
must configure the `imqAddressList` connection factory attribute as
follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel?ServerName= brokerHostName:instanceName
----

or

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
https://hostName:portNumber/contextRoot/tunnel?ServerName= brokerHostName:instanceName
----

where brokerHostName is the broker instance host name and instanceName
is the name of the specific broker instance you want your client to
access.

To check that you have entered the correct values for brokerHostName and
instanceName, generate a status report for the HTTP/HTTPS tunnel servlet
by accessing the servlet URL from a browser:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://localhost:8080/imqhttp/tunnel 
----

The report lists all brokers being accessed by the servlet, as shown in
link:#geyge[Example C-1].

[[aeoqf]][[GMADG00478]][[using-an-http-proxy]]

Using an HTTP Proxy
+++++++++++++++++++

To use an HTTP proxy to access the HTTPS tunnel servlet, set the system
properties `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort` to the proxy server's
host name and port number. You can set these properties using the `-D`
option to the command that launches the client application.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes possible problems with an HTTP or HTTPS
connection and provides guidance on how to handle them.

[[aeoqh]][[GMADG00636]][[server-or-broker-failure]]

Server or Broker Failure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The consequences of a server or broker failure in an (HTTP or HTTPS)
connection vary depending on the specific component that has failed:

* If the application server or Web server fails and is restarted, all
existing connections are restored with no effect on clients.
* If the broker fails and is restarted, an exception is thrown and
clients must reestablish their connections.
* In the unlikely event that both the broker and the application server
or Web server fail and the broker is not restarted, the application
server or Web server will restore client connections and continue
waiting for a broker connection without notifying clients. To avoid this
situation, always restart the broker after a failure.

[[aeoqi]][[GMADG00637]][[client-failure-to-connect-through-the-tunnel-servlet]]

Client Failure to Connect Through the Tunnel Servlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an HTTPS client cannot connect to the broker through the tunnel
servlet, do the following:

[[gbnpn]][[GMADG00208]][[if-a-client-cannot-connect]]

If a Client Cannot Connect
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Start the tunnel servlet and the broker.
2.  Use a browser to access the servlet manually through the tunnel
servlet URL.
3.  Use the following administrative commands to pause and resume the
connection: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause svc   -n httpsjms  -u admin
imqcmd resume svc  -n httpsjms  -u admin
----
When the service resumes, an HTTPS client should be able to connect to
the broker through the tunnel servlet.
