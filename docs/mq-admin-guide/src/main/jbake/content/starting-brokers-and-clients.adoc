3 Starting Brokers and Clients
------------------------------

After installing Message Queue and performing some preparatory steps,
you can begin starting brokers and clients. A broker's configuration is
governed by a set of configuration files, which can be overridden by
command line options passed to the Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`); see
link:broker-configuration.html#aeocl[Configuring a Broker] for more
information.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* link:#aeobv[Preparing System Resources]
* link:#aeoby[Starting Brokers]
* link:#aeoch[Deleting a Broker Instance]
* link:#aeock[Starting Clients]

[[aeobv]][[GMADG00226]][[preparing-system-resources]]

Preparing System Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting a broker, there are two preliminary system-level tasks
to perform: synchronizing system clocks and (on the Solaris or Linux
platform) setting the file descriptor limit. The following sections
describe these tasks.

[[aeobw]][[GMADG00510]][[synchronizing-system-clocks]]

Synchronizing System Clocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting any brokers or clients, it is important to synchronize
the clocks on all hosts that will interact with the Message Queue
system. Synchronization is particularly crucial if you are using message
expiration (time-to-live). Time stamps from clocks that are not
synchronized could prevent message expiration from working as expected
and prevent the delivery of messages. Synchronization is also crucial
for broker clusters.

Configure your systems to run a time synchronization protocol, such as
Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP). Time synchronization is generally
supported by the `xntpd` daemon on Solaris and Linux, and by the
`W32Time` service on Windows. (See your operating system documentation
for information about configuring this service.) After the broker is
running, avoid setting the system clock backward.

[[aeobx]][[GMADG00511]][[setting-the-file-descriptor-limit]]

Setting the File Descriptor Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the Solaris and Linux platforms, the shell in which a client or
broker is running places a soft limit on the number of file descriptors
that a process can use. In Message Queue, each connection a client
makes, or a broker accepts, uses one of these file descriptors. Each
physical destination that has persistent messages also uses a file
descriptor.

As a result, the file descriptor limit constrains the number of
connections a broker or client can have. By default, the maximum is 256
connections on Solaris or 1024 on Linux. (In practice, the connection
limit is actually lower than this because of the use of file descriptors
for persistent data storage.) If you need more connections than this,
you must raise the file descriptor limit in each shell in which a client
or broker will be executing. For information on how to do this, see the
`man` page for the `ulimit` command.

[[aeoby]][[GMADG00227]][[starting-brokers]]

Starting Brokers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start a broker either interactively, using the Message Queue
command line utilities or the Windows Start menu, or by arranging for it
to start automatically at system startup. The following sections
describe how.

[[aeobz]][[GMADG00512]][[starting-brokers-interactively]]

Starting Brokers Interactively
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start a broker interactively from the command line, using the
Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`). (Alternatively, on Windows, you can start
a broker from the Start menu.) You cannot use the Administration Console
(`imqadmin`) or the Command utility (`imqcmd`) to start a broker; the
broker must already be running before you can use these tools.

On the Solaris and Linux platforms, a broker instance must always be
started by the same user who initially started it. Each broker instance
has its own set of configuration properties and file-based persistent
data store. When the broker instance first starts, Message Queue uses
the user's file creation mode mask (`umask`) to set permissions on
directories containing the configuration information and persistent data
for that broker instance.

A broker instance has the instance name `imqbroker` by default. To start
a broker from the command line with this name and the default
configuration, simply use the command

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd
----

This starts a broker instance named `imqbroker` on the local machine,
with the Port Mapper at the default port of `7676` (see
link:connection-services.html#aeoco[Port Mapper]).

To specify an instance name other than the default, use the`-name`
option to the `imqbrokerd` command. The following command starts a
broker with the instance name `myBroker`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -name myBroker 
----

Other options are available on the `imqbrokerd` command line to control
various aspects of the broker's operation. See
link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker Utility] for complete
information on the syntax, subcommands, and options of the `imqbrokerd`
command. For a quick summary of this information, enter the following
command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -help
----

For example, the following command uses the`-tty` option to send errors
and warnings to the command window (standard output):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -name myBroker  -tty
----

You can also use the `-D` option on the command line to override the
values of properties specified in the broker's instance configuration
file (`config.properties`). The instance configuration file is described
under link:broker-configuration.html#aeodd[Modifying Configuration
Files]. The following example sets a broker's `imq.jms.max_threads`
property, raising the maximum number of threads available to the `jms`
connection service to 2000:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -name myBroker  -Dimq.jms.max_threads=2000
----

[[aeoca]][[GMADG00513]][[starting-brokers-automatically]]

Starting Brokers Automatically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of starting a broker explicitly from the command line, you can
set it up to start automatically at system startup. How you do this
depends on the platform (Solaris, Linux, or Windows) on which you are
running the broker:

* link:#ggwew[Automatic Broker Startup on the Solaris Platforms]
* link:#aeocb[Automatic Broker Startup on the Linux Platform]
* link:#aeocc[Automatic Broker Startup on Windows]

[[ggwew]][[GMADG00396]][[automatic-broker-startup-on-the-solaris-platforms]]

Automatic Broker Startup on the Solaris Platforms
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The method for enabling automatic startup on the Solaris 10 platforms is
different from that for Solaris 9. Both are described below.

[[ggwbk]][[GMADG00061]][[automatic-broker-startup-on-the-solaris-9-platform]]

Automatic Broker Startup on the Solaris 9 Platform

On Solaris 9 operating system, scripts that enable automatic startup are
placed in the `/etc/rc*` directory tree during Message Queue
installation. To enable the use of these scripts, you must edit the
configuration file `imqbrokerd.conf` (located in the `IMQ_HOME/etc/`
directory) as follows:

* To start the broker automatically at system startup, set the
`AUTOSTART` property to `YES`.
* To have the broker restart automatically after an abnormal exit, set
the `RESTART` property to `YES`.
* To set startup command line arguments for the broker, specify one or
more values for the `ARGS` property.

To disable automatic broker startup at system startup, edit the
configuration file `/etc/imq/imqbrokerd.conf` and set the `AUTOSTART`
property to `NO`.

[[ggwax]][[GMADG00062]][[automatic-broker-startup-on-the-solaris-10-platform]]

Automatic Broker Startup on the Solaris 10 Platform

Rather than using an `rc` file to implement automatic broker startup
when a computer reboots, the following procedure makes use of the
Solaris 10 Service Management Facility (SMF).

For more information on using the Service Management Facility, please
refer to Solaris 10 documentation.

[[ggwev]][[GMADG00159]][[to-implement-automatic-broker-startup-on-solaris-10-os]]

To Implement Automatic Broker Startup on Solaris 10 OS

1.  Copy and change permissions on the `mqbroker` startup script. +
`# cp /var/svc/manifest/application/sun/mq/mqbroker /lib/svc/method` +
`# chmod 555 /lib/svc/method/mqbroker`
2.  Import the `mqbroker` service into the SMF repository. +
`# svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/sun/mq/mqbroker.xml`
3.  Verify that the import was successful by checking the state of the
`mqbroker` service. +
`# svcs mqbroker` +
Output resembles the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
STATE STIME FMRI
disabled 16:22:50 svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker:default
----
The service is initially shown as disabled.
4.  Eanable the `mqbroker` service. +
`# svcadm enable svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker:default` +
Enabling the mqbroker service will start the `imqbrokerd` process. A
reboot will subsequently restart the broker.
5.  Configure the `mqbroker` service to pass any desired arguments to
the `imqbrokerd` command. +
The `options/broker_args` property is used to pass arguments
to`imqbrokerd`. For example to add `-loglevel DEBUGHIGH`, do the
following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
# svccfg
svc:> select svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker
svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker> setprop options/broker_args="-loglevel DEBUGHIGH"
svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker> exit
----

[[ghati]][[GMADG00160]][[to-disable-automatic-broker-startup-on-solaris-10-os]]

To Disable Automatic Broker Startup on Solaris 10 OS

1.  Disable the `mqbroker` service. +
`# svcadm disable svc:/application/sun/mq/mqbroker:default` +
A subsequent reboot will not restart the broker.

[[aeocb]][[GMADG00397]][[automatic-broker-startup-on-the-linux-platform]]

Automatic Broker Startup on the Linux Platform
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On Linux systems, scripts that enable automatic startup are placed in
the `/etc/rc*` directory tree during Message Queue installation. To
enable the use of these scripts, you must edit the configuration file
`imqbrokerd.conf` (located in the `IMQ_HOME/etc/` directory) as follows:

* To start the broker automatically at system startup, set the
`AUTOSTART` property to `YES`.
* To have the broker restart automatically after an abnormal exit, set
the `RESTART` property to `YES`.
* To set startup command line arguments for the broker, specify one or
more values for the `ARGS` property.

To disable automatic broker startup at system startup, edit the
configuration file `/etc/opt/sun/mq/imqbrokerd.conf` and set the
`AUTOSTART` property to `NO`.

[[aeocc]][[GMADG00398]][[automatic-broker-startup-on-windows]]

Automatic Broker Startup on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To start a broker automatically at Windows system startup, you must
define the broker as a Windows service. The broker will then start at
system startup time and run in the background until system shutdown.
Consequently, you will not need to use the Message Queue Broker utility
(`imqbrokerd`) unless you want to start an additional broker.

A system can have no more than one broker running as a Windows service.
The Windows Task Manager lists such a broker as two executable
processes:

* The native Windows service wrapper, `imqbrokersvc.exe`
* The Java runtime that is running the broker

You can install a broker as a service when you install Message Queue on
a Windows system. After installation, you can use the Service
Administrator utility (`imqsvcadmin`) to perform the following
operations:

* Add a broker as a Windows service
* Determine the startup options for the broker service
* Disable a broker from running as a Windows service

To pass startup options to the broker, use the `-args` option to the
`imqsvcadmin` command. This works the same way as the `imqbrokerd`
command's `-D` option, as described under link:#aeoby[Starting Brokers].
Use the Command utility (`imqcmd`) to control broker operations as
usual.

See link:command-line-reference.html#aeonq[Service Administrator Utility]
for complete information on the syntax, subcommands, and options of the
`imqsvcadmin` command.

[[aeocd]][[GMADG00063]][[reconfiguring-the-broker-service]]

Reconfiguring the Broker Service

The procedure for reconfiguring a broker installed as a Windows service
is as follows:

[[gbnki]][[GMADG00161]][[to-reconfigure-a-broker-running-as-a-windows-service]]

To Reconfigure a Broker Running as a Windows Service

1.  Stop the service:
1.  From the Settings submenu of the Windows Start menu, choose Control
Panel.
2.  Open the Administrative Tools control panel.
3.  Run the Services tool by selecting its icon and choosing Open from
the File menu or the pop-up context menu, or simply by double-clicking
the icon.
4.  Under Services (Local), select the Message Queue Broker service and
choose Properties from the Action menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Message Queue Broker and choose
Properties from the pop-up context menu, or simply double-click on
Message Queue Broker. In either case, the Message Queue Broker
Properties dialog box will appear.
5.  Under the General tab in the Properties dialog, click Stop to stop
the broker service.
2.  Remove the service. +
On the command line, enter the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqsvcadmin remove
----
3.  Reinstall the service, specifying different broker startup options
with the `-args` option or different Java version arguments with the
`-vmargs` option. +
For example, to change the service's host name and port number to
`broker1` and `7878`, you could use the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqsvcadmin install  -args "-name broker1  -port 7878"
----

[[aeoce]][[GMADG00064]][[using-an-alternative-java-runtime]]

Using an Alternative Java Runtime

You can use either the `imqsvcadmin` command's `-javahome` or `-jrehome`
option to specify the location of an alternative Java runtime. (You can
also specify these options in the Start Parameters field under the
General tab in the service's Properties dialog window.)


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The Start Parameters field treats the backslash character (`\`) as an
escape character, so you must type it twice when using it as a path
delimiter: for example,

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
-javahome c:\\j2sdk1.4.0
----

=======================================================================


[[aeocf]][[GMADG00065]][[displaying-broker-service-startup-options]]

Displaying Broker Service Startup Options

To determine the startup options for the broker service, use the
`imqsvcadmin query` command, as shown in link:#gbnji[Example 3-1].

Troubleshooting Service Startup Problems

If you get an error when you try to start a broker as a Windows service,
you can view error events that were logged:

[[gbnkh]][[GMADG00162]][[to-see-logged-service-error-events]]

To See Logged Service Error Events

1.  Open the Windows Administrative Tools control panel.
2.  Start the Event Viewer tool.
3.  Select the Application event log.
4.  Choose Refresh from the Action menu to display any error events.

[[aeoch]][[GMADG00228]][[deleting-a-broker-instance]]

Deleting a Broker Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a broker instance, use the `imqbrokerd` command with the
`-remove` option:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  [options…]-remove instance
----

For example, if the name of the broker is `myBroker`, the command would
be

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -name myBroker  -remove instance
----

The command deletes the entire instance directory for the specified
broker.

See link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker Utility] for complete
information on the syntax, subcommands, and options of the `imqbrokerd`
command. For a quick summary of this information, enter the command

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -help
----

[[aeock]][[GMADG00229]][[starting-clients]]

Starting Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting a client application, obtain information from the
application developer about how to set up the system. If you are
starting Java client applications, you must set the `CLASSPATH` variable
appropriately and make sure you have the correct `.jar` files installed.
The Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients contains
information about generic steps for setting up the system, but your
developer may have additional information to provide.

To start a Java client application, use the following command line
format:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java clientAppName
----

To start a C client application, use the format supplied by the
application developer (see "link:../mq-dev-guide-c/introduction.html#GMCCG00037[Building and Running C
Clients]" in Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for C Clients).

The application's documentation should provide information on attribute
values that the application sets; you may want to override some of these
from the command line. You may also want to specify attributes on the
command line for any Java client that uses a Java Naming and Directory
Interface (JNDI) lookup to find its connection factory. If the lookup
returns a connection factory that is older than the application, the
connection factory may lack support for more recent attributes. In such
cases, Message Queue sets those attributes to default values; if
necessary, you can use the command line to override these default
values.

To specify attribute values from the command line for a Java
application, use the following syntax:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java  [ [-Dattribute=value] … ]clientAppName
----

The value for attribute must be a connection factory administered object
attribute, as described in
link:administered-object-attributes.html#aeood[Administered Object
Attribute Reference]. If there is a space in the value, put quotation
marks around the

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
attribute=value
----

part of the command line.

The following example starts a client application named MyMQClient ,
connecting to a broker on the host `OtherHost` at port `7677`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java  -DimqAddressList=mq://OtherHost:7677/jms  MyMQClient
----

The host name and port specified on the command line override any others
set by the application itself.

In some cases, you cannot use the command line to specify attribute
values. An administrator can set an administered object to allow read
access only, or an application developer can code the client application
to do so. Communication with the application developer is necessary to
understand the best way to start the client program.
