4 Configuring a Broker
----------------------

A broker's configuration is governed by a set of configuration files and
by the options passed to the `imqbrokerd` command at startup. This
chapter describes the available configuration properties and how to use
them to configure a broker.

The chapter contains the following sections:

* link:#aeocm[Broker Services]
* link:#aeodc[Setting Broker Configuration Properties]

For full reference information about broker configuration properties,
see link:broker-properties.html#aeons[Broker Properties Reference].

Broker Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Broker configuration properties are logically divided into categories
that depend on the services or broker components they affect:

* Connection services manage the physical connections between a broker
and its clients that provide transport for incoming and outgoing
messages. For a discussion of properties associated with connection
services, see link:connection-services.html#aeocn[Configuring Connection
Services].
* Message delivery services route and deliver JMS payload messages, as
well as control messages used by the message service to support reliable
delivery. For a discussion of properties associated with message
delivery services, including physical destinations, see
link:message-delivery.html#ghebf[Managing Message Delivery].
* Persistence services manage the writing and retrieval of data, such as
messages and state information, to and from persistent storage. For a
discussion of properties associated with persistence services, see
link:persistence-services.html#gheas[Configuring Persistence Services].
* Security services authenticate users connecting to the broker and
authorize their actions. For a discussion of properties associated with
authentication and authorization services, as well as encryption
configuration, see link:security-services.html#aeoff[Configuring and
Managing Security Services].
* Clustering services support the grouping of brokers into a cluster to
achieve scalability and availability. For a discussion of properties
associated with broker clusters, see
link:broker-clusters.html#aeohv[Configuring and Managing Broker
Clusters].
* Monitoring services generate metric and diagnostic information about
the broker's performance. For a discussion of properties associated with
monitoring and managing a broker, see
link:monitoring.html#aeoik[Monitoring Broker Operations].

Setting Broker Configuration Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a broker's configuration properties in either of two
ways:

* Edit the broker's configuration file.
* Supply the property values directly from the command line.

The following sections describe these two methods of configuring a
broker.

[[aeodd]][[GMADG00514]][[modifying-configuration-files]]

Modifying Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Broker configuration files contain property settings for configuring a
broker. Message Queue maintains the following broker configuration
files:

* A default configuration file
(`IMQ_HOME/lib/props/broker/default.properties`) that is loaded on
startup. This file is not editable, but you can read it to determine
default settings and find the exact names of properties you want to
change.
* An installation configuration file
(`IMQ_HOME/lib/props/broker/install.properties`) containing any
properties specified when Message Queue was installed. This file cannot
be edited after installation.
* A separate instance configuration file
(`IMQ_VARHOME/instances/`instanceName`/props/config.properties`) for
each individual broker instance.

In addition, if you connect broker instances in a cluster, you may need
to use a cluster configuration file (`cluster.properties`) to specify
configuration information for the cluster; see
link:broker-properties.html#aeooa[Cluster Configuration Properties] for
more information.

Also, Message Queue makes use of en environment configuration file,
`imqenv.conf`, which is used to provide the locations of external files
needed by Message Queue, such as the default Java SE location and the
locations of database drivers, JAAS login modules, and so forth.

At startup, the broker merges property values from the various
configuration files. As shown in link:#gbnjd[Figure 4-1], the files form
a hierarchy in which values specified in the instance configuration file
override those in the installation configuration file, which in turn
override those in the default configuration file. At the top of the
hierarchy, you can manually override any property values specified in
the configuration files by using command line options to the
`imqbrokerd` command.

options."]


The first time you run a broker, an instance configuration file is
created containing configuration properties for that particular broker
instance. The instance configuration file is named `config.properties`
and is located in a directory identified by the name of the broker
instance to which it belongs:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_VARHOME/instances/instanceName/props/config.properties
----

If the file does not yet exist, you must use the `-name` option when
starting the broker (see link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker
Utility]) to specify an instance name that Message Queue can use to
create the file.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `instances/`instanceName directory and the instance configuration
file are owned by the user who initially started the corresponding
broker instance by using the `imqbrokerd -name` brokerName option. The
broker instance must always be restarted by that same user.

=======================================================================


The instance configuration file is maintained by the broker instance and
is modified when you make configuration changes using Message Queue
administration utilities. You can also edit an instance configuration
file by hand. To do so, you must be the owner of the
`instances/`instanceName directory or log in as the root user to change
the directory's access privileges.

The broker reads its instance configuration file only at startup. To
effect any changes to the broker's configuration, you must shut down the
broker and then restart it. Property definitions in the
`config.properties` file (or any configuration file) use the following
syntax:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
propertyName=value [ [,value1] â€¦ ]
----

For example, the following entry specifies that the broker will hold up
to 50,000 messages in memory and persistent storage before rejecting
additional messages:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.system.max_count=50000
----

The following entry specifies that a new log file will be created once a
day (every 86,400 seconds):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.log.file.rolloversecs=86400
----

See link:#aeocm[Broker Services] and
link:broker-properties.html#aeons[Broker Properties Reference] for
information on the available broker configuration properties and their
default values.

Setting Configuration Properties from the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can enter broker configuration properties from the command line when
you start a broker, or afterward.

At startup time, you use the Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`) to start a
broker instance. Using the command's `-D` option, you can specify any
broker configuration property and its value; see
link:starting-brokers-and-clients.html#aeoby[Starting Brokers] and
link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker Utility] for more
information. If you start the broker as a Windows service, using the
Service Administrator utility (`imqsvcadmin`), you use the `-args`
option to specify startup configuration properties; see
link:command-line-reference.html#aeonq[Service Administrator Utility].

You can also change certain broker configuration properties while a
broker is running. To modify the configuration of a running broker, you
use the Command utility's `imqcmd` `update` `bkr` command; see
link:broker-management.html#aeodx[Updating Broker Properties] and
link:command-line-reference.html#aeong[Broker Management].
