2 Quick-Start Tutorial
----------------------

This quick-start tutorial provides a brief introduction to Message Queue
administration by guiding you through some basic administrative tasks
using the Message Queue Administration Console, a graphical interface
for administering a message broker and object store. The chapter
consists of the following sections:

* link:#aeoaz[Starting the Administration Console]
* link:#aeoba[Administration Console Online Help]
* link:#aeobb[Working With Brokers]
* link:#aeobg[Working With Physical Destinations]
* link:#aeobl[Working With Object Stores]
* link:#aeobo[Working With Administered Objects]
* link:#aeobt[Running the Sample Application]

The tutorial sets up the physical destinations and administered objects
needed to run a simple JMS-compliant application,
`HelloWorldMessageJNDI`. The application is available in the
`helloworld` subdirectory of the example applications directory,
`IMQ_HOME/examples`. In the last part of the tutorial, you will run this
application.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You must have the Message Queue product installed in order to follow the
tutorial.

=======================================================================


The tutorial is only a basic introduction; it is not a substitute for
reading the documentation. By following the steps described in the
tutorial, you will learn how to

* Start a Message Queue broker
* Connect to a broker and use the Administration Console to manage it
* Create physical destinations on the broker
* Create an object store and use the Administration Console to connect
to it
* Add administered objects to the object store and view their properties


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions given in this tutorial are specific to the Windows
platform. Where necessary, supplemental notes are added for users of
other platforms.

=======================================================================


Some administrative tasks cannot be accomplished using the
Administration Console. You must use command line utilities to perform
such tasks as the following:

* Start up a broker
* Create a broker cluster
* Configure certain physical destination properties
* Manage a JDBC database for persistent storage
* Manage a user repository
* Install a broker as a Windows service
* Generate SSL certificates

All of these tasks are covered in later chapters of this manual.

[[aeoaz]][[GMADG00219]][[starting-the-administration-console]]

Starting the Administration Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the Administration Console, enter the command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_HOME/bin/imqadmin
----

You may need to wait a few seconds before the Administration Console
window is displayed (see link:#gbngn[Figure 2-1]).

[[GMADG00002]][[gbngn]]


.*Figure 2-1 Administration Console Window*
image:img/startupscreen.png[
"Startup screen for Sun Java System Message Queue. Tree view in left
pane; contents in right pane."]


Take a few seconds to examine the Administration Console window. It has
a menu bar at the top, a tool bar just below it, a navigation pane to
the left, a result pane to the right (now displaying graphics
identifying the Message Queue product), and a status pane at the bottom.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

As you work with the Administration Console, you can use the Refresh
command on the View menu to update the visual display of any element or
group of elements, such as a list of brokers or object stores.

=======================================================================


[[aeoba]][[GMADG00220]][[administration-console-online-help]]

Administration Console Online Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Administration Console provides a help facility containing complete
information about how to use the Console to perform administrative
tasks. To use the help facility, pull down the Help menu at the right
end of the menu bar and choose Overview. The Administration Console's
Help window (link:#gbnhm[Figure 2-2]) will be displayed.

[[GMADG00003]][[gbnhm]]


.*Figure 2-2 Administration Console Help Window*
image:img/helpoverview.png[
"Message Queue Administration Console help window. Tree view of available
help topics on left: help topic content window on right."]


The Help window's navigation pane, on the left, organizes topics into
three areas: Message Queue Administration Console, Message Queue Object
Store Management, and Message Queue Broker Management. Within each area
are files and folders. The folders provide help for dialog boxes
containing multiple tabs, the files for simple dialog boxes or
individual tabs. When you select an item in the navigation pane, the
result pane to the right shows the contents of that item. With the
Overview item chosen, the result pane displays a skeletal view of the
Administration Console window identifying each of the window's panes, as
shown in the figure.

Your first task with the Administration Console will be to create a
reference to a broker. Before you start, however, check the Help window
for information. Click the Add Broker item in the Help window's
navigation pane; the contents of the result pane will change to show
text explaining what it means to add a broker and describing the use of
each field in the Add Broker dialog box. Read through the help text,
then close the Help window.

[[aeobb]][[GMADG00221]][[working-with-brokers]]

Working With Brokers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use the Administration Console to connect
to and manage message brokers.

[[aeobc]][[GMADG00496]][[starting-a-broker]]

Starting a Broker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You cannot start a broker using the Administration Console. Instead,
enter the command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_HOME/bin/imqbrokerd
----

If you used the Windows Start menu, the command window will appear,
indicating that the broker is ready by displaying lines like the
following:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Loading persistent data...    Broker "imqbroker@stan:7676 ready.
----

Reactivate the Administration Console window. You are now ready to add
the broker to the Console and connect to it. You do not have to start
the broker before adding a reference to it in the Administration
Console, but you must start it before you can connect to it.

[[aeobd]][[GMADG00497]][[adding-a-broker-to-the-administration-console]]

Adding a Broker to the Administration Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding a broker creates a reference to that broker in the Administration
Console. After adding the broker, you can connect to it.

[[gbngl]][[GMADG00145]][[to-add-a-broker-to-the-administration-console]]

To Add a Broker to the Administration Console
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Click on the Brokers item in the Administration Console window's
navigation pane and choose Add Broker from the Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Brokers and choose Add Broker from
the pop-up context menu. In either case, the Add Broker dialog box
(link:#gbnid[Figure 2-3]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00004]][[gbnid]]


.*Figure 2-3 Add Broker Dialog Box*
image:img/addbrokerdlog.png[
"Add Broker dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Reset to Defaults,
Cancel, Help."]

2.  Enter a name for the broker in the Broker Label field. +
This provides a label that identifies the broker in the Administration
Console. +
Note the default host name (`localhost`) and primary port ( `7676`)
specified in the dialog box. These are the values you must specify
later, when you configure the connection factory that the client will
use to create connections to this broker. +
For this exercise, type the name `MyBroker` into the Broker Label field.
Leave the Password field blank; your password will be more secure if you
specify it at connection time.
3.  Click OK to add the broker and dismiss the dialog box. +
The new broker will appear under Brokers in the navigation pane, as
shown in link:#gbngo[Figure 2-4]. The red X over the broker's icon
indicates that it is not currently connected to the Administration
Console. +
[[GMADG00005]][[gbngo]]


.*Figure 2-4 Broker Displayed in Administration Console Window*
image:img/brokers.png[
"Message Queue Administration Console window. Broker selected in tree
view."]

Once you have added a broker, you can use the Properties command on the
Actions menu (or the pop-up context menu) to display a Broker Properties
dialog box, similar to the Add Broker dialog shown in link:#aeobd[Adding
a Broker to the Administration Console], to view or modify any of its
properties.

[[aeobe]][[GMADG00498]][[connecting-to-a-broker]]

Connecting to a Broker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have added a broker to the Administration Console, you can
proceed to connect to it.

[[gbngw]][[GMADG00146]][[to-connect-to-a-broker]]

To Connect to a Broker
++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Click on the broker's name in the Administration Console window's
navigation pane and choose Connect to Broker from the Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on the broker's name and choose
Connect to Broker from the pop-up context menu. In either case, the
Connect to Broker dialog box ( link:#gbngp[Figure 2-5]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00006]][[gbngp]]


.*Figure 2-5 Connect to Broker Dialog Box*
image:img/connectbkrdlog.png[
"Connect to Broker dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Cancel, Help."]

2.  Enter the user name and password with which to connect to the
broker. +
The dialog box initially displays the default user name, `admin` . In a
real-world environment, you should establish secure user names and
passwords as soon as possible (see link:security-services.html#aeofg[User
Authentication]); for this exercise, simply use the default value. +
The password associated with the default user name is also `admin`; type
it into the Password field in the dialog box. This will connect you to
the broker with administrative privileges.
3.  Click OK to connect to the broker and dismiss the dialog box. +
Once you have connected to the broker, you can use the commands on the
Actions menu (or the context menu) to perform the following operations
on a selected broker:
* Pause Broker temporarily suspends the operation of a running broker.
* Resume Broker resumes the operation of a paused broker.
* Restart Broker reinitializes and restarts a broker.
* Shut Down Broker terminates the operation of a broker.
* Query/Update Broker displays or modifies a broker's configuration
properties.
* Disconnect from Broker terminates the connection between a broker and
the Administration Console.

[[aeobf]][[GMADG00499]][[viewing-connection-services]]

Viewing Connection Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A broker is distinguished by the connection services it provides and the
physical destinations it supports.

[[gbnhr]][[GMADG00147]][[to-view-available-connection-services]]

To View Available Connection Services
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Services under the broker's name in the Administration
Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available services will appear in the result pane (see
link:#gbnie[Figure 2-6]), showing the name, port number, and current
state of each service. +
[[GMADG00007]][[gbnie]]


.*Figure 2-6 Viewing Connection Services*
image:img/services.png[
"Message Queue Administration Console window. Broker services node
selected. Contents of node displayed in the contents pane."]

2.  Select a service by clicking on its name in the result pane. +
For this exercise, select the name `jms`.
3.  Choose Properties from the Actions menu. +
The Service Properties dialog box (link:#gbnja[Figure 2-7]) will appear.
You can use this dialog box to assign the service a static port number
and to change the minimum and maximum number of threads allocated for
it. +
[[GMADG00008]][[gbnja]]


.*Figure 2-7 Service Properties Dialog Box*
image:img/jmsservpropsdlog.png[
"Service Properties dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Cancel, Help."]

For this exercise, do not change any of the connection service's
properties.
4.  Click OK to accept the new property values and dismiss the dialog
box. +
The Actions menu also contains commands for pausing and resuming a
service. If you select the admin service and pull down the Actions menu,
however, you will see that the Pause Service command is disabled. This
is because the admin service is the Administration Console's link to the
broker: if you paused it, you would no longer be able to access the
broker.

[[aeobg]][[GMADG00222]][[working-with-physical-destinations]]

Working With Physical Destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A physical destination is a location on a message broker where messages
received from a message producer are held for later delivery to one or
more message consumers. Destinations are of two kinds, depending on the
messaging domain in use: queues (point-to-point domain) and topics
(publish/subscribe domain). See the Open Message Queue Technical
Overview for further discussion of messaging domains and the
destinations associated with them.

[[aeobh]][[GMADG00500]][[creating-a-physical-destination]]

Creating a Physical Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, message brokers are configured to create new physical
destinations automatically whenever a message producer or consumer
attempts to access a nonexistent destination. Such auto-created
destinations are convenient to use while testing client code in a
software development environment. In a production setting, however, it
is advisable to disable the automatic creation of destinations and
instead require all destinations to be created explicitly by an
administrator. The following procedure shows how to add such an
admin-created destination to a broker.

[[gbnio]][[GMADG00148]][[to-add-a-physical-destination-to-a-broker]]

To Add a Physical Destination to a Broker
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Click on the Destinations item under the broker's name in the
Administration Console window's navigation pane and choose Add Broker
Destination from the Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Destinations and choose Add Broker
Destination from the pop-up context menu. In either case, the Add Broker
Destination dialog box (link:#gbnim[Figure 2-8]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00009]][[gbnim]]


.*Figure 2-8 Add Broker Destination Dialog Box*
image:img/addphysdestdlog.png[
"Add Broker Destination Dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Reset To
Defaults, Cancel, Help."]

2.  Enter a name for the physical destination in the Destination Name
field. +
Note the name that you assign to the destination; you will need it later
when you create an administered object corresponding to this physical
destination. +
For this exercise, type in the name `MyQueueDest`.
3.  Select the Queue or Topic radio button to specify the type of
destination to create. +
For this exercise, select Queue if it is not already selected.
4.  Click OK to add the physical destination and dismiss the dialog box. +
The new destination will appear in the result pane.

[[aeobi]][[GMADG00501]][[viewing-physical-destination-properties]]

Viewing Physical Destination Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the Properties command on the Administration Console's
Actions menu to view or modify the properties of a physical destination.

[[gbniy]][[GMADG00149]][[to-view-or-modify-the-properties-of-a-physical-destination]]

To View or Modify the Properties of a Physical Destination
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Destinations under the broker's name in the Administration
Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available physical destinations will appear in the result
pane, showing the name, type, and current state of each destination.
2.  Select a physical destination by clicking on its name in the result
pane.
3.  Choose Properties from the Actions menu. +
The Broker Destination Properties dialog box (link:#gbniq[Figure 2-9])
will appear, showing current status and configuration information about
the selected physical destination. You can use this dialog box to change
various configuration properties, such as the maximum number of
messages, producers, and consumers that the destination can accommodate. +
[[GMADG00010]][[gbniq]]


.*Figure 2-9 Broker Destination Properties Dialog Box*
image:img/physdestpropsdlog.png[
"Broker Destinations Properties dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK,
Cancel, Help."]

For this exercise, do not change any of the destination's properties. +
For topic destinations, the Broker Destination Properties dialog box
contains an additional tab, Durable Subscriptions. Clicking on this tab
displays information for Durable Subscriptions, such as the Subscription
Name, Client ID, and Number of Messages. +
You can use the Durable Subscriptions panel's Purge and Delete buttons
to
* Purge all pending messages associated with a durable subscription
* Remove a durable subscription from the topic +
The Durable Subscriptions tab is disabled for queue destinations.
4.  Click OK to accept the new property values and dismiss the dialog
box.

[[aeobj]][[GMADG00502]][[purging-messages-from-a-physical-destination]]

Purging Messages From a Physical Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purging messages from a physical destination removes all pending
messages associated with the destination, leaving the destination empty.

[[gbnil]][[GMADG00150]][[to-purge-messages-from-a-physical-destination]]

To Purge Messages From a Physical Destination
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Destinations under the broker's name in the Administration
Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available physical destinations will appear in the result
pane, showing the name, type, and current state of each destination.
2.  Select a destination by clicking on its name in the result pane.
3.  Choose Purge Messages from the Actions menu. +
A confirmation dialog box will appear, asking you to confirm that you
wish to proceed with the operation.
4.  Click Yes to confirm the operation and dismiss the confirmation
dialog.

[[aeobk]][[GMADG00503]][[deleting-a-physical-destination]]

Deleting a Physical Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deleting a destination purges all of its messages and then destroys the
destination itself, removing it permanently from the broker to which it
belongs.

[[gbnij]][[GMADG00151]][[to-delete-a-physical-destination]]

To Delete a Physical Destination
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Destinations under the broker's name in the Administration
Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available destinations will appear in the result pane,
showing the name, type, and current state of each destination.
2.  Select a destination by clicking on its name in the result pane.
3.  Choose Delete from the Edit menu. +
A confirmation dialog box will appear, asking you to confirm that you
wish to proceed with the operation.
4.  Click Yes to confirm the operation and dismiss the confirmation
dialog. +
For this exercise, do not delete the destination `MyQueueDest` that you
created earlier; instead, click No to dismiss the confirmation dialog
without performing the delete operation.

[[aeobl]][[GMADG00223]][[working-with-object-stores]]

Working With Object Stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An object store is used to store Message Queue administered objects,
which encapsulate implementation and configuration information specific
to a particular Message Queue provider. An object store can be either a
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory server or a
directory in the local file system.

Although it is possible to instantiate and configure administered
objects directly from within a client application's code, it is
generally preferable to have an administrator create and configure these
objects and store them in an object store, where client applications can
access them using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This
allows the client code itself to remain provider-independent.

[[aeobm]][[GMADG00504]][[adding-an-object-store]]

Adding an Object Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although the Administration Console allows you to manage an object
store, you cannot use it to create one; the LDAP server or file-system
directory that will serve as the object store must already exist ahead
of time. You can then add this existing object store to the
Administration Console, creating a reference to it that you can use to
operate on it from within the Console.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The sample application used in this chapter assumes that the object
store is held in a directory named `Temp` on the C drive. If you do not
already have a folder named `Temp` on your C drive, create one before
proceeding with the following exercise. (On non-Windows platforms, you
can use the `/tmp` directory, which should already exist.)

=======================================================================


[[gbnip]][[GMADG00152]][[to-add-an-object-store-to-the-administration-console]]

To Add an Object Store to the Administration Console
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Click on the Object Stores item in the Administration Console
window's navigation pane and choose Add Object Store from the Actions
menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Object Stores and choose Add
Object Store from the pop-up context menu. In either case, the Add
Object Store dialog box (link:#gbnis[Figure 2-10]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00012]][[gbnis]]


.*Figure 2-10 Add Object Store Dialog Box*
image:img/addobjstoredlog.png[
"Add Object Store dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Clear, Cancel,
Help."]

2.  Enter a name for the object store in the Object Store Label field. +
This provides a label that identifies the object store in the
Administration Console. +
For this exercise, type in the name `MyObjectStore`.
3.  Enter the JNDI attribute values to be used for looking up
administered objects:
1.  Select the name of the attribute you wish to specify from the Name
pull-down menu.
2.  Type the value of the attribute into the Value field.
3.  Click the Add button to add the specified attribute value. +
The property and its value will appear in the property summary pane. +
Repeat steps link:#aeobm[Adding an Object Store] to link:#aeobm[Adding
an Object Store] for as many attributes as you need to set. +
For this exercise, set the `java.naming.factory.initial` attribute to +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
----
and the `java.naming.provider.url` attribute to +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
file:///C:/Temp
----
(or `file:///tmp` on the Solaris or Linux platforms). These are the only
attributes you need to set for a file-system object store; see
link:administered-objects.html#aeogw[LDAP Server Object Stores] for
information on the attribute values needed for an LDAP store.
4.  Click OK to add the object store and dismiss the dialog box. +
The new object store will appear under Object Stores in the navigation
pane, as shown in link:#gbnix[Figure 2-11]. The red X over the object
store's icon indicates that it is not currently connected to the
Administration Console. +
[[GMADG00013]][[gbnix]]


.*Figure 2-11 Object Store Displayed in Administration Console Window*
image:img/adminobjects.png[
"Message Queue Administration Console window. Object store node selected
in tree view pane."]

When you click on the object store in the navigation pane, its contents
are listed in the result pane. Since you have not yet added any
administered objects to the object store, the Count column shows 0 for
both destinations and connection factories. +
Once you have added an object store, you can use the Properties command
on the Actions menu (or the pop-up context menu) to display an Object
Store Properties dialog box, similar to the Add Object Store dialog
shown in link:#gbnis[Figure 2-10], to view or modify any of its
properties.

[[aeobn]][[GMADG00505]][[connecting-to-an-object-store]]

Connecting to an Object Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have added an object store to the Administration Console,
you must connect to it in order to add administered objects to it.

[[gbnin]][[GMADG00153]][[to-connect-to-an-object-store]]

To Connect to an Object Store
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Click on the object store's name in the Administration Console
window's navigation pane and choose Connect to Object Store from the
Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on the object store's name and choose
Connect to Object Store from the pop-up context menu. In either case,
the red X will disappear from the object store's icon, indicating that
it is now connected to the Administration Console.

[[aeobo]][[GMADG00224]][[working-with-administered-objects]]

Working With Administered Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have connected an object store to the Administration Console,
you can proceed to add administered objects (connection factories and
destinations) to it. This section describes how.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The Administration Console displays only Message Queue administered
objects. If an object store contains a non-Message Queue object with the
same lookup name as an administered object that you want to add, you
will receive an error when you attempt the add operation.

=======================================================================


[[aeobp]][[GMADG00506]][[adding-a-connection-factory]]

Adding a Connection Factory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connection factories are used by client applications to create
connections to a broker. By configuring a connection factory, you can
control the properties of the connections it creates.

[[gbniv]][[GMADG00154]][[to-add-a-connection-factory-to-an-object-store]]

To Add a Connection Factory to an Object Store
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Make sure the object store is connected to the Administration
Console (see link:#aeobn[Connecting to an Object Store]).
2.  Click on the Connection Factories item under the object store's name
in the Administration Console window's navigation pane and choose Add
Connection Factory Object from the Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Connection Factories and choose
Add Connection Factory Object from the pop-up context menu. In either
case, the Add Connection Factory Object dialog box ( link:#gbnik[Figure
2-12]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00014]][[gbnik]]


.*Figure 2-12 Add Connection Factory Object Dialog Box*
image:img/addcfadminobjdlog.png[
"Add Connection Factory Object dialog; Connection Handling tab shown.
Buttons from left to right: OK, Reset to Defaults, Cancel, Help."]

3.  Enter a name for the connection factory in the Lookup Name field. +
This is the name that client applications will use when looking up the
connection factory with JNDI. +
For this exercise, type in the name `MyQueueConnectionFactory` .
4.  Choose the type of connection factory you wish to create from the
Factory Type pull-down menu. +
For this exercise, choose QueueConnectionFactory.
5.  Click the Connection Handling tab. +
The Connection Handling panel will appear, as shown in
link:#gbnik[Figure 2-12].
6.  Fill in the Message Server Address List field with the address(es)
of the broker(s) to which this connection factory will create
connections. +
The address list may consist of a single broker or (in the case of a
broker cluster) multiple brokers. For each broker, it specifies
information such as the broker's connection service, host name, and port
number. The exact nature and syntax of the information to be specified
varies, depending on the connection service to be used; see
link:administered-object-attributes.html#aeoof[Connection Handling] for
specifics. +
For this exercise, there is no need to type anything into the Message
Server Address List field, since the sample application
`HelloWorldMessageJNDI` expects the connection factory to use the
standard address list attributes to which it is automatically configured
by default (connection service `jms` , host name `localhost`, and port
number `7676` ).
7.  Configure any other attributes of the connection factory as needed. +
The Add Connection Factory Object dialog box contains a number of other
panels besides Connection Handling, which can be used to configure
various attributes for a connection factory. +
For this exercise, do not change any of the other attribute settings.
You may find it instructive, however, to click through the other tabs to
get an idea of the kinds of configuration information that can be
specified. Use the Help button to learn more about the contents of these
other configuration panels.
8.  If appropriate, click the Read-Only checkbox. +
This locks the connection factory object's configuration attributes to
the values they were given at creation time. A read-only administered
object's attributes cannot be overridden, whether programmatically from
client code or administratively from the command line. +
For this exercise, do not check Read-Only.
9.  Click OK to create the connection factory, add it to the object
store, and dismiss the dialog box. +
The new connection factory will appear in the result pane.

[[aeobq]][[GMADG00507]][[adding-a-destination]]

Adding a Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A destination administered object represents a physical destination on a
broker, enabling clients to send messages to that physical destination
independently of provider-specific configurations and naming syntax.
When a client sends a message addressed via the administered object, the
broker will deliver the message to the corresponding physical
destination, if it exists. If no such physical destination exists, the
broker will create one automatically if auto-creation is enabled, as
described under link:#aeobh[Creating a Physical Destination], and
deliver the message to it; otherwise, it will generate an error
signaling that the message cannot be delivered.

The following procedure describes how to add a destination administered
object to the object store corresponding to an existing physical
destination.

[[gbnit]][[GMADG00155]][[to-add-a-destination-to-an-object-store]]

To Add a Destination to an Object Store
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Make sure the object store is connected to the Administration
Console (see link:#aeobn[Connecting to an Object Store]).
2.  Click on the Destinations item under the object store's name in the
Administration Console window's navigation pane and choose Add
Destination Object from the Actions menu. +
Alternatively, you can right-click on Destinations and choose Add
Destination Object from the pop-up context menu. In either case, the Add
Destination Object dialog box (link:#gbnih[Figure 2-13]) will appear. +
[[GMADG00015]][[gbnih]]


.*Figure 2-13 Add Destination Object Dialog Box*
image:img/addqueueadminobjdlog.png[
"Add Destination Object dialog. Buttons from left to right: OK, Reset to
Defaults, Cancel, Help."]

3.  Enter a name for the destination administered object in the Lookup
Name field. +
This is the name that client applications will use when looking up the
destination with JNDI. +
For this exercise, type in the name `MyQueue`.
4.  Select the Queue or Topic radio button to specify the type of

For this exercise, select Queue if it is not already selected.
5.  Enter the name of the corresponding physical destination in the
Destination Name field. +
This is the name you specified when you added the physical destination
to the broker (see link:#aeobg[Working With Physical Destinations]). +
For this exercise, type in the name `MyQueueDest`.
6.  Optionally, enter a brief description of the destination in the
Destination Description field. +
The contents of this field are intended strictly for human consumption
and have no effect on client operations. +
For this exercise, you can either delete the contents of the Destination
Description field or type in some descriptive text such as +

7.  If appropriate, click the Read-Only checkbox. +
This locks the destination object's configuration attributes to the
values they were given at creation time. A read-only administered
object's attributes cannot be overridden, whether programmatically from
client code or administratively from the command line. +
For this exercise, do not check Read-Only.
8.  Click OK to create the destination object, add it to the object
store, and dismiss the dialog box. +
The new destination object will appear in the result pane, as shown in

Viewing Administered Object Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the Properties command on the Administration Console's
Actions menu to view or modify the properties of an administered object.

[[gbniw]][[GMADG00156]][[to-view-or-modify-the-properties-of-an-administered-object]]

To View or Modify the Properties of an Administered Object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Connection Factories or Destinations under the object store's
name in the Administration Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available connection factory or destination administered
objects will appear in the result pane, showing the lookup name and type
of each (as well as the destination name in the case of destination
administered objects).
2.  Select an administered object by clicking on its name in the result
pane.
3.  Choose Properties from the Actions menu. +
The Connection Factory Object Properties or Destination Object
Properties dialog box will appear, similar to the Add Connection Factory
Object (link:#gbnik[Figure 2-12]) or Add Destination Object
(link:#gbnih[Figure 2-13]) dialog. You can use this dialog box to change
the selected object's configuration attributes. Note, however, that you
cannot change the object's lookup name; the only way to do this is the
delete the object and then add a new administered object with the
desired lookup name.
4.  Click OK to accept the new attribute values and dismiss the dialog
box.

Deleting an Administered Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deleting an administered object removes it permanently from the object
store to which it belongs.

[[gbniu]][[GMADG00157]][[to-delete-an-administered-object]]

To Delete an Administered Object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select Connection Factories or Destinations under the object store's
name in the Administration Console window's navigation pane. +
A list of the available connection factory or destination administered
objects will appear in the result pane, showing the lookup name and type

administered objects).
2.  Select an administered object by clicking on its name in the result
pane.
3.  Choose Delete from the Edit menu. +
A confirmation dialog box will appear, asking you to confirm that you
wish to proceed with the operation.
4.  Click Yes to confirm the operation and dismiss the confirmation

Running the Sample Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample application `HelloWorldMessageJNDI` is provided for use with
this tutorial. It uses the physical destination and administered objects
that you created:

* A queue physical destination named `MyQueueDest`
* A queue connection factory administered object with JNDI lookup name
`MyQueueConnectionFactory`
* A queue administered object with JNDI lookup name `MyQueue`

The code creates a simple queue sender and receiver, and sends and
receives a `Hello` `World` message.

Before running the application, open the source file
`HelloWorldMessageJNDI.java` and read through the code. The program is
short and amply documented; you should have little trouble understanding
how it works.

[[gbniz]][[GMADG00158]][[to-run-the-sample-application]]

To Run the Sample Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Make the directory containing the `HelloWorldmessageJNDI`
application your current directory: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd IMQ_HOME/examples/helloworld/helloworldmessagejndi
----
You should find the file `HelloWorldMessageJNDI.class` present. (If you
make changes to the application, you must recompile it using the
procedure for compiling a client application given in the Open Message
Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients.)
2.  Set the `CLASSPATH` variable to include the current directory
containing the file `HelloWorldMessageJNDI.class`, as well as the
following `.jar` files that are included in the Message Queue product:
* `jms.jar`
* `imq.jar`
* `jndi.jar`
* `fscontext.jar` +
See the Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients for
information on setting the `CLASSPATH` variable. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The file `jndi.jar` is bundled with JDK 1.4. You need not add this file
to your `CLASSPATH` unless you are using an earlier version of the JDK.

=======================================================================

3.  Run the `HelloWorldMessageJNDI` application by executing one of the
following commands (depending on the platform you're using):
* On Solaris or Linux: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
% java HelloWorldMessageJNDI file:///tmp 
----
* On Windows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java HelloWorldMessageJNDI
----
If the application runs successfully, you should see the output shown in
link:#gecip[Example 2-1].
