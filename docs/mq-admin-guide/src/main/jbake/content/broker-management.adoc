Command Utility Preliminaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the Command utility to manage a broker, you must do the
following:

* Start the broker using the `imqbrokerd` command. You cannot use the
Command utility subcommands l until a broker is running.
* Determine whether you want to set up a Message Queue administrative
user or use the default account. You must specify a user name and
password to use all Command utility subcommands (except to display
command help and version information). +
When you install Message Queue, a default flat-file user repository is
installed. The repository is shipped with two default entries: an
administrative user and a guest user. If you are testing Message Queue,
you can use the default user name and password (`admin`/`admin`) to run
the Command utility. +
If you are setting up a production system, you must set up
authentication and authorization for administrative users. See
link:security-services.html#aeoff[Configuring and Managing Security
Services] for information on setting up a file-based user repository or
configuring the use of an LDAP directory server. In a production
environment, it is a good security practice to use a nondefault user
name and password.
* If you want to use a secure connection to the broker, set up and
enable the `ssladmin` service on the target broker instance, For more
information, see link:security-services.html#aeogb[Message Encryption].

[[aeodo]][[GMADG00233]][[using-the-command-utility]]

Using the Command Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Message Queue Command utility (`imqcmd`) enables you to manage the
broker and its services interactively from the command line. See
link:command-line-reference.html#aeonf[Command Utility] for general
reference information about the syntax, subcommands, and options of the
`imqcmd` command, and link:broker-properties.html#aeons[Broker Properties
Reference] for specific information on the configuration properties used
to specify broker behavior.

[[aeodr]][[GMADG00516]][[specifying-the-user-name-and-password]]

Specifying the User Name and Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because each `imqcmd` subcommand is authenticated against the user
repository, it requires a user name and password. The only exceptions
are commands that use the `-h` or `-H` option to display help, and those
that use the `-v` option to display the product version.

Use the `-u` option to specify an administrative user name. For example,
the following command displays information about the default broker:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query bkr  -u admin 
----

If you omit the user name, the command will prompt you for it.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

For simplicity, the examples in this chapter use the default user name
`admin` as the argument to the `-u` option. In a real-life production
environment, you would use a custom user name.

=======================================================================


Specify the password using one of the following methods:

* Create a password file and enter the password into that file as the
value of the `imq.imqcmd.password` property. On the command line, use
the `-passfile` option to provide the name of the password file.
* Let the `imqcmd` command prompt you for the password.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In previous versions of Message Queue, you could use the `-p` option to
specify a password on the `imqcmd` command line. As of Message Queue
4.0, this option is deprecated and is no longer supported; you must
instead use one of the methods listed above.

=======================================================================


[[aeodu]][[GMADG00517]][[specifying-the-broker-name-and-port]]

Specifying the Broker Name and Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most `imqcmd` subcommands use the `-b` option to specify the host name
and the port mapper port number of the broker to which the command
applies:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
-b hostName:portNumber
----

If no broker is specified, the command applies by default to a broker
running on the local host (`localhost`) at port mapper port number
`7676`. See link:connection-services.html#aeoco["Port Mapper"] for more
information.

To issue a command to a broker that is running on a remote host,
listening on a non-default port, or both, you must use the `-b` option
to specify the host and port explicitly.

Literal IP addresses as host names: You can use a literal IPv4 or IPv6
address as a host name. If you use a literal IPv6 address, its format
must conform to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt[RFC2732], Format for
Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's.

[[aeodq]][[GMADG00518]][[displaying-the-product-version]]

Displaying the Product Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To display the Message Queue product version, use the `-v` option. For
example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd  -v
----

If you enter an `imqcmd` command line containing the `-v` option in
addition to a subcommand or other options, the Command utility processes
only the `-v` option. All other items on the command line are ignored.

[[aeodp]][[GMADG00519]][[displaying-help]]

Displaying Help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To display help on the `imqcmd` command, use the `-h` or `-H` option,
and do not use a subcommand. You cannot get help about specific
subcommands.

For example, the following command displays help about `imqcmd`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd  -H
----

If you enter an `imqcmd` command line containing the `-h` or `-H` option
in addition to a subcommand or other options, the Command utility
processes only the `-h` or `-H` option. All other items on the command
line are ignored.

[[aeodv]][[GMADG00520]][[examples]]

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The examples in this section illustrate how to use the `imqcmd` command.

The following example lists the properties of the broker running on host
`localhost` at port `7676`, so the `-b` option is unnecessary:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query bkr  -u admin 
----

The command uses the default administrative user name (`admin`) and
omits the password, so that the command will prompt for it.

The following example lists the properties of the broker running on the
host `myserver` at port `1564`. The user name is `aladdin`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query bkr  -b myserver:1564  -u aladdin
----

(For this command to work, the user repository would need to be updated
to add the user name `aladdin` to the `admin` group.)

The following example lists the properties of the broker running on
`localhost` at port `7676`. The initial timeout for the command is set
to 20 seconds and the number of retries after timeout is set to 7. The
user's password is in a password file called `myPassfile`, located in
the current directory at the time the command is invoked.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query bkr  -u admin  -passfile myPassfile  -rtm 20  -rtr 7
----

For a secure connection to the broker, these examples could include the
`-secure` option. This option causes the Command utility to use the
`ssladmin` service if that service has been configured and started.

[[geobv]][[GMADG00234]][[managing-brokers]]

Managing Brokers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use Command utility subcommands to perform
the following broker management tasks:

* link:#aeoeb[Shutting Down and Restarting a Broker]
* link:#geodc[Quiescing a Broker]
* link:#aeody[Pausing and Resuming a Broker]
* link:#aeodx[Updating Broker Properties]
* link:#aeodw[Viewing Broker Information]

In addition to using the subcommands described in the following
sections, `imqcmd` allows you to set system properties using the `-D`
option. This is useful for setting or overriding connection factory
properties or connection-related Java system properties.

For example, the following command changes the default value of
`imqSSLIsHostTrusted`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc -secure -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true
----

The following command specifies the password file and the password used
for the SSL trust store that is used by the `imqcmd` command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc -secure -DJavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/tmp/MyTruststore
              -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=MyTrustword
----

[[aeoeb]][[GMADG00521]][[shutting-down-and-restarting-a-broker]]

Shutting Down and Restarting a Broker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `shutdown` `bkr` shuts down a broker:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd shutdown bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
[-time nSeconds]
[-nofailover]
----

The broker stops accepting new connections and messages, completes
delivery of existing messages, and terminates the broker process.

The `-time` option, if present, specifies the interval, in seconds, to
wait before shutting down the broker. For example, the following command
delays 90 seconds and then shuts down the broker running on host
`wolfgang` at port `1756`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd shutdown bkr  -b wolfgang:1756  -time 90  -u admin
----

The broker will not block, but will return immediately from the delayed
shutdown request. During the shutdown interval, the broker will not
accept any new `jms` connections; `admin` connections will be accepted,
and existing `jms` connections will continue to operate. If the broker
belongs to an enhanced broker cluster, it will not attempt to take over
for any other broker during the shutdown interval.

If the broker is part of an enhanced broker cluster (see
"link:../mq-tech-over/broker-clusters.html#GMTOV00068[Enhanced Clusters]" in Open Message Queue Technical
Overview), another broker in the cluster will ordinarily attempt to take
over its persistent data on shutdown; the `-nofailover` option to the
`imqcmd` `shutdown` `bkr` subcommand suppresses this behavior.
Conversely, you can use the `imqcmd` `takeover` `bkr` subcommand to
force such a takeover manually (for instance, if the takeover broker
were to fail before completing the takeover process); see
link:broker-clusters.html#gecjm[Preventing or Forcing Broker Failover]
for more information.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `imqcmd` `takeover` `bkr` subcommand is intended only for use in
failed-takeover situations. You should use it only as a last resort, and
not as a general way of forcibly taking over a running broker.

=======================================================================


To shut down and restart a broker, use the subcommand `imqcmd` `restart`
`bkr`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd restart bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

This shuts down the broker and then restarts it using the same options
that were specified when it was first started. To choose different
options, shut down the broker with `imqcmd` `shutdown` `bkr` and then
start it again with the Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`), specifying the
options you want.

[[geodc]][[GMADG00522]][[quiescing-a-broker]]

Quiescing a Broker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `quiesce` `bkr` quiesces a broker, causing it to
refuse any new client connections while continuing to service old ones:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd quiesce bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

If the broker is part of an enhanced broker cluster, this allows its
operations to wind down normally without triggering a takeover by
another broker, for instance in preparation for shutting it down
administratively for upgrade or similar purposes. For example, the
following command quiesces the broker running on host `hastings` at port
`1066`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd quiesce bkr  -b hastings:1066  -u admin
----

To reverse the process and return the broker to normal operation, use
the `imqcmd` `unquiesce` `bkr` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd unquiesce bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command unquiesces the broker that was
quiesced in the preceding example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd unquiesce bkr  -b hastings:1066  -u admin
----

[[aeody]][[GMADG00523]][[pausing-and-resuming-a-broker]]

Pausing and Resuming a Broker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `pause` `bkr` pauses a broker, suspending its
connection service threads and causing it to stop listening on the
connection ports:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command pauses the broker running on host
`myhost` at port `1588`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause bkr  -b myhost:1588  -u admin
----

Because its connection service threads are suspended, a paused broker is
unable to accept new connections, receive messages, or dispatch
messages. The `admin` connection service is not suspended, allowing you
to continue performing administrative tasks needed to regulate the flow
of messages to the broker. Pausing a broker also does not suspend the
`cluster` connection service; however, since message delivery within a
cluster depends on the delivery functions performed by the different
brokers in the cluster, pausing a broker in a cluster may result in a
slowing of some message traffic.

You can also pause individual connection services and physical
destinations. For more information, see
link:connection-services.html#aeoei[Pausing and Resuming a Connection
Service] and link:message-delivery.html#aeoet[Pausing and Resuming a
Physical Destination].

The subcommand `imqcmd` `resume` `bkr` reactivates a broker's service
threads, causing it to resume listening on the ports:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
----

For example, the following command resumes the default broker (host
`localhost` at port `7676`):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume bkr  -u admin 
----

[[aeodx]][[GMADG00524]][[updating-broker-properties]]

Updating Broker Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `update` `bkr` can be used to change the values
of a subset of broker properties for the default broker (or for the
broker at a specified host and port):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update bkr [-b hostName:portNumber]
-o property1=value1  [ [-o property2=value2] … ]
----

For example, the following command turns off the auto-creation of queue
destinations for the default broker:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update bkr  -o imq.autocreate.queue=false  -u admin
----

You can use `imqcmd` `update` `bkr` to update any of the following
broker properties:

* `imq.autocreate.queue`
* `imq.autocreate.topic`
* `imq.autocreate.queue.maxNumActiveConsumers`
* `imq.autocreate.queue.maxNumBackupConsumers`
* `imq.cluster.url`
* `imq.destination.DMQ.truncateBody`
* `imq.destination.logDeadMsgs`
* `imq.log.level`
* `imq.log.file.rolloversecs`
* `imq.log.file.rolloverbytes`
* `imq.system.max_count`
* `imq.system.max_size`
* `imq.message.max_size`
* `imq.portmapper.port`

See link:broker-properties.html#aeons[Broker Properties Reference] for
detailed information about these properties.

[[aeodw]][[GMADG00525]][[viewing-broker-information]]

Viewing Broker Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To display information about a single broker, use the `imqcmd` `query`
`bkr` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query bkr  -b hostName:portNumber
----

This lists the current settings of the broker's properties, as shown in

The `imqcmd` `metrics` `bkr` subcommand displays detailed metric
information about a broker's operation:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics bkr  [-b hostName:portNumber]
[-m metricType]
[-int interval]
[-msp numSamples]
----

The `-m` option specifies the type of metric information to display:

* `ttl` (default): Messages and packets flowing into and out of the
broker
* `rts`: Rate of flow of messages and packets into and out of the broker
per second
* `cxn`: Connections, virtual memory heap, and threads

The `-int` and `-msp` options specify, respectively, the interval (in
seconds) at which to display the metrics and the number of samples to
display in the output. The default values are 5 seconds and an unlimited
number of samples.

For example, the following command displays the rate of message flow
into and out of the default broker (host `localhost` at port `7676`) at
10-second intervals:
