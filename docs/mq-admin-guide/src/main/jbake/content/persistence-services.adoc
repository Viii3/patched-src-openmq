8 Configuring Persistence Services
----------------------------------

For a broker to recover in case of failure, it needs to re-create the
state of its message delivery operations. To do this, the broker must
save state information to a persistent data store. When the broker
restarts, it uses the saved data to re-create destinations and durable
subscriptions, recover persistent messages, roll back open transactions,
and rebuild its routing table for undelivered messages. It can then
resume message delivery.

A persistent data store is thus a key aspect of providing for reliable
message delivery. This chapter describes the two different persistence
implementations supported by the Message Queue broker and how to set
each of them up:

Introduction to Persistence Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A broker's persistent data store holds information about physical
destinations, durable subscriptions, messages, transactions, and
acknowledgments.

Message Queue supports both file-based and JDBC-based persistence
modules, as shown in the following figure. File-based persistence uses
individual files to store persistent data; JDBC-based persistence uses
the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) interface to connect the broker to
a JDBC-based data store. While file-based persistence is generally
faster than JDBC-based persistence, some users prefer the redundancy and
administrative control provided by a JDBC database. The broker
configuration property `imq.persist.store` (see
link:broker-properties.html#gbnmp[Table 17-5]) specifies which of the two
persistence modules (`file` or `jdbc`) to use.

or a JDBC-based data store."]


Message Queue brokers are configured by default to use a file-based
persistent store, but you can reconfigure them to plug in any data store
accessible through a JDBC-compliant driver. The broker configuration
property `imq.persist.store` (see link:broker-properties.html#gbnmp[Table
17-5]) specifies which of the two forms of persistence to use.

[[gheap]][[GMADG00243]][[file-based-persistence]]

File-Based Persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Message Queue uses a file-based data store, in which
individual files store persistent data (such as messages, destinations,
durable subscriptions, transactions, and routing information).

The file-based data store is located in a directory identified by the
name of the broker instance (instanceName) to which the data store
belongs:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_VARHOME/instances/instanceName/fs370
----

Each destination on the broker has its own subdirectory holding messages
delivered to that destination.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Because the data store can contain messages of a sensitive or
proprietary nature, you should secure the
`IMQ_VARHOME/instances/`instanceName`/fs370` directory against
unauthorized access; see link:#aeodk[Securing a File-Based Data Store].

=======================================================================


[[aeocs]][[GMADG00539]][[file-based-persistence-properties]]

File-Based Persistence Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Broker configuration properties related to file-based persistence are
listed under link:broker-properties.html#aeonw[File-Based Persistence
Properties]. These properties let you configure various aspects of how
the file-based data store behaves.

All persistent data other than messages is stored in separate files: one
file each for destinations, durable subscriptions, and transaction state
information. Most messages are stored in a single file consisting of
variable-size records. You can compact this file to alleviate
fragmentation as messages are added and removed (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoew[Managing Physical Destination Disk
Utilization]). In addition, messages above a certain threshold size are
stored in their own individual files rather than in the variable-sized
record file. You can configure this threshold size with the broker
property `imq.persist.file.message.max_record_size`.

The broker maintains a file pool for these individual message files:
instead of being deleted when it is no longer needed, a file is returned
to the pool of free files in its destination directory so that it can
later be reused for another message. The broker property
`imq.persist.file.destination.message.filepool.limit` specifies the
maximum number of files in the pool. When the number of individual
message files for a destination exceeds this limit, files will be
deleted when no longer needed instead of being returned to the pool.

When returning a file to the file pool, the broker can save time at the
expense of storage space by simply tagging the file as available for
reuse without deleting its previous contents. You can use the
`imq.persist.file.message.filepool.cleanratio` broker property to
specify the percentage of files in each destination's file pool that
should be maintained in a "clean" (empty) state rather than simply
marked for reuse. The higher you set this value, the less space will be
required for the file pool, but the more overhead will be needed to
empty the contents of files when they are returned to the pool. If the
broker's `imq.persist.file.message.cleanup` property is `true`, all
files in the pool will be emptied at broker shutdown, leaving them in a
clean state; this conserves storage space but slows down the shutdown
process.

In writing data to the data store, the operating system has some leeway
in whether to write the data synchronously or "lazily" (asynchronously).
Lazy storage can lead to data loss in the event of a system crash, if
the broker believes the data to have been written to the data store when
it has not. To ensure absolute reliability (at the expense of
performance), you can require that all data be written synchronously by
setting the broker property `imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` to `true`.
In this case, the data is guaranteed to be available when the system
comes back up after a crash, and the broker can reliably resume
operation.

[[aeodh]][[GMADG00540]][[configuring-a-file-based-data-store]]

Configuring a File-Based Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A file-based data store is automatically created when you create a
broker instance. However, you can configure the data store using the
properties described in link:#aeocs[File-Based Persistence Properties].

For example, by default, Message Queue performs asynchronous write
operations to disk. However, to attain the highest reliability, you can
set the broker property `imq.persist.file.sync` to write data
synchronously instead. See link:broker-properties.html#gbnnh[Table 17-6].

When you start a broker instance, you can use the `imqbrokerd` command's
`-- reset` option to clear the file-based data store. For more
information about this option and its suboptions, see
link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker Utility].

[[aeodk]][[GMADG00541]][[securing-a-file-based-data-store]]

Securing a File-Based Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The persistent data store can contain, among other information, message
files that are being temporarily stored. Since these messages may
contain proprietary information, it is important to secure the data
store against unauthorized access. This section describes how to secure
data in a file-based data store.

A broker using file-based persistence writes persistent data to a
flat-file data store:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_VARHOME/instances/instanceName/fs370
----

where instanceName is a name identifying the broker instance. This
directory is created when the broker instance is started for the first
time. The procedure for securing this directory depends on the operating
system platform on which the broker is running:

* On Solaris and Linux, the directory's permissions are determined by
the file mode creation mask (`umask`) of the user who started the broker
instance. Hence, permission to start a broker instance and to read its
persistent files can be restricted by setting the mask appropriately.
Alternatively, an administrator (superuser) can secure persistent data
by setting the permissions on the `instances` directory to `700`.
* On Windows, the directory's permissions can be set using the
mechanisms provided by the Windows operating system. This generally
involves opening a Properties dialog for the directory.

[[gjmqy]][[GMADG00542]][[optimizing-file-based-transaction-persistence]]

Optimizing File-Based Transaction Persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because many activities can occur during a transaction, persisting a
transaction's state over the complete life cycle of the transaction can
adversely affect overall performance, especially when the
`imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` property is set to `true` to avoid data
loss in case of a system crash.

Message Queue provides a transaction logging mechanism that can improve
performance of transaction persistence. This transaction log offers
tuning parameters that can improve performance of file-based persistence
for other objects, such as message payloads.

To enable this transaction logging mechanism, set the
`imq.persist.file.newTxnLogenabled` broker property to `true`.

After enabling the transaction log, essential changes to the state of a
JMS transaction are written to the transaction log. When the transaction
is committed, all details regarding it are gathered and written to the
persistent store. Additionally, the logging mechanism periodically
performs a "checkpoint" operation to ensure that the persistent store
and the transaction log are synchronized and that the log size remains
manageable.

As a further refinement, the operation of the logging mechanism is
subject to the value of the `imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` broker
property:

* When `imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` is `true`, write operations to
the transaction log are written synchronously to disk. Non-transacted
message and non-transacted message acknowledgements are also written
synchronously to the transaction log before being written asynchronously
to the persistent store.
* When `imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` is `false`, write operations to
the transaction log are written asynchronously to disk. Non-transacted
message and non-transacted message acknowledgements are not written to
the transaction log.

The tuning parameters supported by the transaction logging mechanism
are:

* `imq.persist.file.txnLog.groupCommit`
* `imq.persist.file.txnLog.logNonTransactedMsgSend`
* `imq.persist.file.txnLog.logNonTransactedMsgAck`

Information about these parameters can be found in
link:broker-properties.html#gjmtg[Table 17-7].

[[gheaz]][[GMADG00244]][[jdbc-based-persistence]]

JDBC-Based Persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using a file-based data store, you can set up a broker to
access any data store accessible through a JDBC-compliant driver. This
involves setting the appropriate JDBC-related broker configuration
properties and using the Database Manager utility (`imqdbmgr`) to create
the proper database schema. See link:#aeodi[Configuring a JDBC-Based
Data Store] for specifics.

[[aeoct]][[GMADG00543]][[jdbc-based-persistence-properties]]

JDBC-Based Persistence Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full set of properties for configuring a broker to use a JDBC
database are listed in link:broker-properties.html#gbnoa[Table 17-8]. You
can specify these properties either in the instance configuration file
(`config.properties`) of each broker instance or by using the `-D`
command line option to the Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`) or the Database
Manager utility (`imqdbmgr`).

In practice, however, JDBC properties are preconfigured by default,
depending on the database vendor being used for the data store. The
property values are set in the `default.properties` file, and only need
to be explicitly set if you are overriding the default values. In
general, you only need to set the following properties:

* `imq.persist.store` +
This property specifies that a JDBC-based data store (as opposed to the
default file-based data store) is used to store persistent data.
* `imq.persist.jdbc.dbVendor` +
This property identifies the database vendor being used for the data
store; all of the remaining properties are qualified by this vendor
name.
* `imq.persist.jdbc`vendorName`.user` +
This property specifies the user name to be used by the broker in
accessing the database.
* `imq.persist.jdbc`vendorName`.password` +
This property specifies the password for accessing the database, if
required; `imq.persist.jdbc.`vendorName`.needpassword` is a boolean flag
specifying whether a password is needed. For security reasons, the
database access password should be specified only in a password file
referenced with the `-passfile` command line option; if no such password
file is specified, the `imqbrokerd` and `imqdbmgr` commands will prompt
for the password interactively.
* `imq.persist.jdbc.`vendorName`.property.`propName +
This set of properties represents any additional, vendor-specific
properties that are required.
* `imq.persist.jdbc.`vendorName`.tableoption` +
Specifies the vendor-specific options passed to the database when
creating the table schema.

----

If you expect to have messages that are larger than 1 MB, configure
MySQL's `max_allowed_packet` variable accordingly when starting the
database. For more information see Appendix B of the MySQL 5.0 Reference
Manual.

In addition, in an enhanced broker cluster, in which a JDBC database is
shared by multiple broker instances, each broker must be uniquely
identified in the database (unnecessary for an embedded database, which
stores data for only one broker instance). The configuration property
`imq.brokerid` specifies a unique instance identifier to be appended to
the names of database tables for each broker. See
link:broker-clusters.html#ggult[Enhanced Broker Cluster Properties].

After setting all of the broker's needed JDBC configuration properties,
you must also install your JDBC driver's `.jar` file in
`IMQ_HOME/lib/ext` and then create the database schema for the
JDBC-based data store (see link:#gbnjm[To Set Up a JDBC-Based Data
Store]).

[[aeodi]][[GMADG00544]][[configuring-a-jdbc-based-data-store]]

Configuring a JDBC-Based Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure a broker to use a JDBC database, you set JDBC-related
properties in the broker's instance configuration file and create the
appropriate database schema. The Message Queue Database Manager utility
(`imqdbmgr`) uses your JDBC driver and the broker configuration
properties to create the schema and manage the database. You can also
use the Database Manager to delete corrupted tables from the database or
if you want to use a different database as a data store. See
link:command-line-reference.html#aeono[Database Manager Utility] for more
information.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

If you use an embedded database, it is best to create it under the
following directory:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
   .../instances/instanceName/dbstore/databaseName
----

If an embedded database is not protected by a user name and password, it
is probably protected by file system permissions. To ensure that the
database is readable and writable by the broker, the user who runs the
broker should be the same user who created the embedded database using
the `imqdbmgr` command.

[[gbnjm]][[GMADG00163]][[to-set-up-a-jdbc-based-data-store]]

To Set Up a JDBC-Based Data Store
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Set JDBC-related properties in the broker's instance configuration
file. +
The relevant properties are discussed, with examples, in
link:#aeoct[JDBC-Based Persistence Properties] and listed in full in
link:broker-properties.html#gbnoa[Table 17-8]. In particular, you must
specify a JDBC-based data store by setting the broker's
`imq.persist.store` property to `jdbc`.
2.  Place a copy of, or a symbolic link to, your JDBC driver's `.jar`
file in `IMQ_HOME/lib/ext`, the Message Queue external resource files
directory.
3.  Check the message table schema for your database in
`IMQ_HOME/lib/props/broker/default.properties`. +
In the `default.properties` file, locate the message table schema for
your database by searching for "imq.persist.jdbc.vendor.table.MQMSG".
Read any commentary notes about the schema and check that the maximum
message size is sufficient; if it is not, adjust the size of the MESSAGE
column as needed.
4.  Create the database schema needed for Message Queue persistence. +
Use the `imqdbmgr create all` command (for an embedded database) or the
`imqdbmgr create tbl` command (for an external database); see
link:command-line-reference.html#aeono[Database Manager Utility].
1.  Change to the directory where the Database Manager utility resides: +

2.  Enter the `imqdbmgr` command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqdbmgr create all
----
5.  Optionally, if your JDBC driver does not provide automatic
reconnect, you can configure the following:
* `imq.persist.jdbc.connection.retry.delay` specifies the amount of
time, in milliseconds, the broker waits before it attempts to retry
connecting to a database server for a failed connection.
* `imq.persist.jdbc.connection.retry.max` specifies the maximum number
of times the broker will retry connecting to a database server after a
failed connection.
* `imq.persist.jdbc.``vendorName``.connection.retry.regex.``n` specifies
1 or more regular expressions, to be used to match `SQLException`
messages in order to identify retriable database communication failures.

Securing a JDBC-Based Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The persistent data store can contain, among other information, message
files that are being temporarily stored. Since these messages may
contain proprietary information, it is important to secure the data
store against unauthorized access. This section describes how to secure
data in a JDBC-based data store.

A broker using JDBC-based persistence writes persistent data to a
JDBC-compliant database. For a database managed by a database server
(such as Oracle), it is recommended that you create a user name and
password to access the Message Queue database tables (tables whose names
start with `MQ`). If the database does not allow individual tables to be
protected, create a dedicated database to be used only by Message Queue
brokers. See the documentation provided by your database vendor for
information on how to create user name/password access.

The user name and password required to open a database connection by a
broker can be provided as broker configuration properties. However it is
more secure to provide them as command line options when starting up the
broker, using the `imqbrokerd` command's `-dbuser`and `-dbpassword`
options (see link:command-line-reference.html#aeone[Broker Utility]).

For an embedded database that is accessed directly by the broker by
means of the database's JDBC driver, security is usually provided by
setting file permissions on the directory where the persistent data will
be stored, as described above under link:#aeodk[Securing a File-Based
Data Store] To ensure that the database is readable and writable by both
the broker and the Database Manager utility, however, both should be run
by the same user.

[[ggwal]][[GMADG00245]][[data-store-formats]]

Data Store Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes in the file formats for both file-based and JDBC-based
persistent data stores were introduced in Message Queue 3.7, with
further JDBC changes in version 4.0 and 4.1. As a result of these
changes, the persistent data store version numbers have been updated to
370 for file-based data stores and 410 for JDBC-based stores. You can
use the `imqdbmgr` `query` command to determine the version number of
your existing data store.

On first startup, the Message Queue Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`) will
check for the presence of an older persistent data store and
automatically migrate it to the latest format:

* File-based data store versions 200 and 350 are migrated to the version
370 format.
* JDBC-based data store versions 350, 370, and 400 are migrated to the
version 410 format. (If you need to upgrade a version 200 data store,
you will need to step through an intermediate Message Queue 3.5 or 3.6
release.)

The upgrade leaves the older copy of the persistent data store intact,
allowing you to roll back the upgrade if necessary. To do so, you can
uninstall the current version of Message Queue and reinstall the earlier
version you were previously running. The older version's message brokers
will locate and use the older copy of the data store.

Beginning in Message Queue 4.5, the `imq.persist.file.newTxnLog`
property is `true` by default. This setting can generate an error when
starting a broker that is using an older persistent data store. To
resolve the error, set the property value to `false` and start the
broker, thus migrating the data store to the latest format. Then, you
can stop the broker, set the property value back to `true`, and start
the broker without encountering an error.
