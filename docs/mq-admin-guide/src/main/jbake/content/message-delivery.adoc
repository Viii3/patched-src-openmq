7 Managing Message Delivery
---------------------------

A Message Queue message is routed to its consumer clients by way of a
physical destination on a message broker. The broker manages the memory
and persistent storage associated with the physical destination and
configures its behavior. The broker also manages memory at a system-wide
level, to assure that sufficient resources are available to support all
destinations.

Message delivery also involves the maintenance of state information
needed by the broker to route messages to consumers and to track
acknowledgements and transactions.

This chapter provides information needed to manage message delivery, and
includes the following topics:

Configuring and Managing Physical Destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use the Message Queue Command utility
(`imqcmd`) to manage physical destinations. It includes discussion of a
specialized physical destination managed by the broker, the dead message
queue, whose properties differ somewhat from those of other
destinations.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In a broker cluster, you create a physical destination on one broker and
the cluster propagates it to all the others. Because the brokers
cooperate to route messages across the cluster, client applications can
consume messages from destinations on any broker in the cluster. However
the persistence and acknowledgment of a message is managed only by the
broker to which a message was originally produced.

=======================================================================


This section covers the following topics regarding the management of
physical destinations:

[NOTE]

For provider independence and portability, client applications typically
use destination administered objects to interact with physical
destinations. link:administered-objects.html#aeogu[Managing Administered
Objects] describes how to configure such administered objects for use by
client applications. For a general conceptual introduction to physical
destinations, see the Open Message Queue Technical Overview.

Command Utility Subcommands for Physical Destination Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Message Queue Command utility (`imqcmd`) enables you to manage
physical destinations interactively from the command line. See

general reference information about the syntax, subcommands, and options
of the `imqcmd` command, and
link:physical-destination-properties.html#aeooc[Physical Destination
Property Reference] for specific information on the configuration
properties used to specify physical destination behavior.

[[aeoep]][[GMADG00532]][[creating-and-destroying-physical-destinations]]

Creating and Destroying Physical Destinations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `create` `dst` creates a new physical
destination:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd create dst  -t destType  -n destName
                      [ [-o property=value] â€¦ ]
----

You supply the destination type (`q` for a queue or `t` for a topic) and
the name of the destination.

[[ghcfr]][[GMADG00399]][[naming-destinations]]

Naming Destinations
+++++++++++++++++++

Destination names must conform to the rules described below for queue
and topic destinations.

[[ghcft]][[GMADG00068]][[supported-queue-destination-names]]

Supported Queue Destination Names

Queue destination names must conform to the following rules:

* It must contain only alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`), digit
characters (`0`-`9`), underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
* It must not contain spaces.
* It must begin with an alphabetic character (`A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`), an
underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`).
* It must not begin with the characters `mq`.

For example, the following command creates a queue destination named
`XQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd create dst  -t q  -n XQueue
----

[[ghcda]][[GMADG00069]][[supported-topic-destination-names]]

Supported Topic Destination Names

Topic destination names must conform to the same rules as queue
destinations, as specified in link:#ghcft[Supported Queue Destination
Names], except that Message Queue also supports, in addition, topic
destination names that include wildcard characters, representing
multiple destinations. These symbolic names allow publishers to publish
messages to multiple topics and subscribers to consume messages from
multiple topics. Using symbolic names, you can create destinations, as
needed, consistent with the wildcard naming scheme. Publishers and
subscribers automatically publish to and consume from any added
destinations that match the symbolic names. (Wildcard topic subscribers
are more common than publishers.)

The format of a symbolic topic destination name consists of multiple
segments, in which wildcard characters (`*`, `**`, `>`) can represent
one or more segments of the name. For example, suppose you have a topic
destination naming scheme as follows:

size.color.shape

where the topic name segments can have the following values:

* size: `large`, `medium`, `small`, ...
* color: `red`, `green`, `blue`, ...
* shape: `circle`, `triangle`, `square`, ...

Message Queue supports the following wildcard characters:

* `*` matches a single segment
* `**` matches one or more segments
* `>` matches any number of segments and must not be proceeded by '.'

You can therefore indicate multiple topic destinations as follows:

`large.*.circle` would represent:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
large.red.circle
large.green.circle
...
----

`**.square` would represent all names ending in `.square`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
small.green.square
medium.blue.square
...
----

`small>` would represent the destination `small` and all destination
names starting with `small.`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
small
small.blue.circle
small.red.square
...
----

It would not, for example, match `smallyellow`.

To use this multiple destination feature, you create topic destinations
using a naming scheme similar to that described above. For example, the
following command creates a topic destination named
`large.green.circle`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd create dst  -t t  -n large.green.circle
----

Client applications can then create wildcard publishers or wildcard
consumers using symbolic destination names.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Oracle recommends storing and looking up Topic objects in JNDI. It is
the topic name which contains the wildcard, not the JNDI name

=======================================================================


For example:

[[GMADG00107]][[ghcfy]]


Example 7-1 Wildcard Publisher

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
...
String topicName = "large.*.circle";
Topic t = session.createTopic(topicName) 
TopicPublisher myPublisher = mySession.createPublisher(t)
myPublisher.send(myMessage);
...
----

In this example, the broker will place a copy of the message in any
destination that matches the symbolic name `large.*.circle`

[[GMADG00108]][[ghccr]]


Example 7-2 Wildcard Subscriber

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
...
String topicName = "**.square";
Topic t = session.createTopic(topicName);
TopicSubscriber mySubscriber = mySession.createSubscriber(t);
Message m = mySubscriber.receive();
...
----

In this example, a subscriber will be created if there is at least one
destination that matches the symbolic name `**.square` and will receive
messages from all destinations that match that symbolic name. If there
are no destinations matching the symbolic name, the subscriber will not
be registered with the broker until such a destination exists.

If you create additional destinations that match a symbolic name, then
wildcard publishers created using that symbolic name will subsequently
publish to that destination and wildcard subscribers created using that
symbolic name will subsequently receive messages from that destination.

In addition, Message Queue administration tools, in addition to
reporting the total number of publishers (producers) and subscribers
(consumers) for a topic destination, will also report the number of
publishers that are wildcard publishers (including their corresponding
symbolic destination names) and the number of subscribers that are
wildcard subscribers (including their symbolic destination names), if
any. See link:#aeoer[Viewing Physical Destination Information].

[[ghcgy]][[GMADG00400]][[setting-property-values]]

Setting Property Values
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The `imqcmd` `create` `dst` command may also optionally include any
property values you wish to set for the destination, specified with the
`-o` option. For example, the following command creates a topic
destination named `hotTopic` with a maximum message length of 5000
bytes:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd create dst  -t t  -n hotTopic  -o maxBytesPerMsg=5000
----

See link:physical-destination-properties.html#aeooc[Physical Destination
Property Reference] for reference information about the physical
destination properties that can be set with this option. (For
auto-created destinations, you set default property values in the
broker's instance configuration file; see
link:broker-properties.html#gbnof[Table 17-3] for information on these
properties.)

[[ghcee]][[GMADG00401]][[destroying-destinations]]

Destroying Destinations
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To destroy a physical destination, use the `imqcmd` `destroy` `dst`
subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd destroy dest  -t destType  -n destName
----

This purges all messages at the specified destination and removes it
from the broker; the operation is not reversible.

For example, the following command destroys the queue destination named
`curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd destroy dest  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
----


[NOTE]
=========================================

You cannot destroy the dead message queue.

=========================================


[[aeoet]][[GMADG00533]][[pausing-and-resuming-a-physical-destination]]

Pausing and Resuming a Physical Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pausing a physical destination temporarily suspends the delivery of
messages from producers to the destination, from the destination to
consumers, or both. This can be useful, for instance, to prevent
destinations from being overwhelmed when messages are being produced
much faster than they are consumed. You must also pause a physical
destination before compacting it (see link:#aeoew[Managing Physical
Destination Disk Utilization]).

To pause the delivery of messages to or from a physical destination, use
the `imqcmd` `pause` `dst` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause dest  [-t destType  -n destName]
[-pst pauseType]
----

If you omit the destination type and name (`-t` and `-n` options), all
physical destinations will be paused. The pause type (`-pst`) specifies
what type of message delivery to pause:

`PRODUCERS`::
  Pause delivery from message producers to the destination
`CONSUMERS`::
  Pause delivery from the destination to message consumers
`ALL`::
  Pause all message delivery (both producers and consumers)

If no pause type is specified, all message delivery will be paused.

For example, the following command pauses delivery from message
producers to the queue destination `curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -pst PRODUCERS  -u admin
----

The following command pauses delivery to message consumers from the
topic destination `hotTopic`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause dst  -t t  -n hotTopic  -pst CONSUMERS  -u admin
----

This command pauses all message delivery to and from all physical
destinations:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause dst  -u admin 
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In a broker cluster, since each broker in the cluster has its own
instance of each physical destination, you must pause each such instance
individually.

=======================================================================


The `imqcmd` `resume` `dst` subcommand resumes delivery to a paused
destination:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume dest  [-t destType  -n destName]
----

For example, the following command resumes message delivery to the queue
destination `curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
----

If no destination type and name are specified, all destinations are
resumed. This command resumes delivery to all physical destinations:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd resume dst  -u admin 
----

[[aeoeu]][[GMADG00534]][[purging-a-physical-destination]]

Purging a Physical Destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purging a physical destination deletes all messages it is currently
holding. You might want to do this when a destination's accumulated
messages are taking up too much of the system's resources, such as when
a queue is receiving messages but has no registered consumers to which
to deliver them, or when a topic's durable subscribers remain inactive
for long periods of time.

To purge a physical destination, use the `imqcmd` `purge` `dst`
subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd purge dst  -t destType  -n destName
----

For example, the following command purges all accumulated messages from
the topic destination `hotTopic`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd purge dst  -t t  -n hotTopic  -u admin
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In a broker cluster, since each broker in the cluster has its own
instance of each physical destination, you must purge each such instance
individually.

=======================================================================



[TIP]
=======================================================================

When restarting a broker that has been shut down, you can use the Broker
utility's `-reset messages` option to clear out its stale messages: for
example,

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd -reset messages  -u admin
----

This saves you the trouble of purging physical destinations after
restarting the broker.

=======================================================================


[[aeoes]][[GMADG00535]][[updating-physical-destination-properties]]

Updating Physical Destination Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subcommand `imqcmd` `update` `dst` changes the values of specified
properties of a physical destination:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update dst  -t destType  -n destName
-o property1=value1  [ [-o property2=value2] â€¦ ]
----

The properties to be updated can include any of those listed in
link:physical-destination-properties.html#gbnne[Table 18-1] (with the
exception of the `isLocalOnly` property, which cannot be changed once
the destination has been created). For example, the following command
changes the `maxBytesPerMsg` property of the queue destination
`curlyQueue` to `1000` and the `maxNumMsgs` property to `2000`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
-o maxBytesPerMsg=1000
-o maxNumMsgs=2000
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The type of a physical destination is not an updatable property; you
cannot use the `imqcmd` `update` `dst` subcommand to change a queue to a
topic or a topic to a queue.

=======================================================================


[[aeoer]][[GMADG00536]][[viewing-physical-destination-information]]

Viewing Physical Destination Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To list the physical destinations on a broker, use the `imqcmd` `list`
`dst` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list dst  -b hostName:portNumber  [-t destType][-tmp]
----

This lists all physical destinations on the broker identified by
hostName and portNumber of the type (queue or topic) specified by
destType. If the `-t` option is omitted, both queues and topics are
listed. For example, the following command lists all physical
destinations on the broker running on host `myHost` at port number
`4545`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list dst  -b myHost:4545 
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The list of queue destinations always includes the dead message queue
(`mq.sys.dmq`) in addition to any other queue destinations currently
existing on the broker.

=======================================================================


If you specify the `-tmp` option, temporary destinations are listed as
well. These are destinations created by clients, normally for the
purpose of receiving replies to messages sent to other clients.

The `imqcmd` `query` `dst` subcommand displays information about a
single physical destination:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq query dst  -t destType  -n destName
----

For example, the following command displays information about the queue
destination `curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
----

link:#gfbec[Example 7-3] shows an example of the resulting output. You
can use the `imqcmd` `update` `dst` subcommand (see link:#aeoes[Updating
Physical Destination Properties]) to change the value of any of the
properties listed.

For destinations in a broker cluster, it is often helpful to know how
many messages in a destination are local (produced to the local broker)
and how many are remote (produced to a remote broker). Hence,
`imqcmd query dst` reports, in addition to the number and total message
bytes of messages in the destination, the number and total bytes of
messages that are sent to the destination from remote brokers in the
cluster.

For topic destinations, `imqcmd query dst` reports the number of
publishers that are wildcard publishers (including their corresponding
symbolic destination names) and the number of subscribers that are
wildcard subscribers (including their symbolic destination names), if
any.

To display metrics information about a physical destination, use the
`imqcmd` `metrics` `dst` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics dst   -t destType  -n destName
[-m metricType]
[-int interval]
[-msp numSamples]
----

The `-m` option specifies the type of metric information to display:

* `ttl` (default): Messages and packets flowing into and out of the
destination and residing in memory
* `rts`: Rate of flow of messages and packets into and out of the
destination per second, along with other rate information
* `con`: Metrics related to message consumers
* `dsk`: Disk usage

The `-int` and `-msp` options specify, respectively, the interval (in
seconds) at which to display the metrics and the number of samples to
display in the output. The default values are 5 seconds and an unlimited
number of samples.

For example, the following command displays cumulative totals for
messages and packets handled by the queue destination `curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -m ttl  -u admin

[[aeoew]][[GMADG00537]][[managing-physical-destination-disk-utilization]]

Managing Physical Destination Disk Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the way message storage is structured in a file-based
persistent data store (see
link:persistence-services.html#aeocs[File-Based Persistence Properties]),
disk space can become fragmented over time, resulting in inefficient
utilization of the available resources. Message Queue's Command utility
(`imqcmd`) provides subcommands for monitoring disk utilization by
physical destinations and for reclaiming unused disk space when
utilization drops.

To monitor a physical destination's disk utilization, use the `imqcmd`
`metrics` `dst` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics dst  -m dsk  -t destType  -n destMame
----

This displays the total number of bytes of disk space reserved for the
destination's use, the number of bytes currently in use to hold active
messages, and the percentage of available space in use (the disk
utilization ratio). For example, the following command displays disk
utilization information for the queue destination `curlyQueue`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd metrics dst  -m dsk  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
----

link:#gfbdk[Example 7-5] shows an example of the resulting output.

[[GMADG00111]][[gfbdk]]


Example 7-5 Destination Disk Utilization Listing

[source,oac_no_warn]
----

--------------------------------------
Reserved   Used      Utilization Ratio
--------------------------------------
804096     675533    84
1793024    1636222   91
2544640    2243808   88
----

The disk utilization pattern depends on the characteristics of the
messaging application using a particular physical destination. Depending
on the flow of messages into and out of the destination and their
relative size, the amount of disk space reserved might grow over time.
If messages are produced at a higher rate than they are consumed, free
records should generally be reused and the utilization ratio should be
on the high side. By contrast, if the rate of message production is
comparable to or lower than the consumption rate, the utilization ratio
will likely be low.

As a rule, you want the reserved disk space to stabilize and the
utilization ratio to remain high. If the system reaches a steady state
in which the amount of reserved disk space remains more or less constant
with utilization above 75%, there is generally no need to reclaim unused
disk space. If the reserved space stabilizes at a utilization rate below
50%, you can use the `imqcmd` `compact` `dst` subcommand to reclaim the
disk space occupied by free records:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
compact dst  [-t destType  -n destName]
----

This compacts the file-based data store for the designated physical
destination. If no destination type and name are specified, all physical
destinations are compacted.

You must pause a destination (with the `imqcmd` `pause` subcommand)
before compacting it, and resume it (with `imqcmd` `resume`) afterward
(see link:#aeoet[Pausing and Resuming a Physical Destination]):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd pause dst    -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
imqcmd compact dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
imqcmd resume dst   -t q  -n curlyQueue  -u admin
----


[TIP]
=======================================================================

If a destination's reserved disk space continues to increase over time,
try reconfiguring its `maxNumMsgs`, `maxBytesPerMsg`,
`maxTotalMsgBytes`, and `limitBehavior` properties (see
link:physical-destination-properties.html#gbnms[Physical Destination
Properties]).

The dead message queue, `mq.sys.dmq`, is a system-created physical
destination that holds the dead messages of a broker's physical
destinations. The dead message queue is a tool for monitoring, tuning
system efficiency, and troubleshooting. For a definition of the term
dead message and a more detailed introduction to the dead message queue,
see the Open Message Queue Technical Overview.

The broker automatically creates a dead message queue when it starts.
The broker places messages on the queue if it cannot process them or if
their time-to-live has expired. In addition, other physical destinations
can use the dead message queue to hold discarded messages. This can
provide information that is useful for troubleshooting the system.

Managing the Dead Message Queue
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The physical destination configuration property `useDMQ` controls a
destination's use of the dead message queue. Physical destinations are
configured to use the dead message queue by default; to disable a
destination from using it, set the destination's `useDMQ` property to
`false`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update dst  -t q  -n curlyQueue  -o useDMQ=false
----

You can enable or disable the use of the dead message queue for all
auto-created physical destinations on a broker by setting the broker's
`imq.autocreate.destination.useDMQ` broker property:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update bkr  -o imq.autocreate.destination.useDMQ=false 
----

You can manage the dead message queue with the Message Queue Command
utility (`imqcmd`) just as you manage other queues, but with some
differences. For example, because the dead message queue is
system-created, you cannot create, pause, or destroy it. Also, as shown
in link:#gbnke[Table 7-2], default values for the dead message queue's
configuration properties sometimes differ from those of ordinary queues.

|=======================================================================



[TIP]
=======================================================================

By default, the dead message queue stores entire messages. If you do not
plan to restore dead messages, you can reduce the size of the dead
message queue by setting the broker's `imq.destination.DMQ.truncateBody`
property to `true`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update bkr  -o imq.destination.DMQ.truncateBody=true 
----

This will discard the body of all messages and retain only the headers
and property data.

=======================================================================


[[aeofe]][[GMADG00403]][[enabling-dead-message-logging]]

Enabling Dead Message Logging
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The broker configuration property `logDeadMsgs` controls the logging of
events related to the dead message queue. When dead message logging is
enabled, the broker will log the following events:

* A message is moved to the dead message queue.
* A message is discarded from the dead message queue (or from any
physical destination that does not use the dead message queue).
* A physical destination reaches its limits.

Dead message logging is disabled by default. The following command
enables it:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd update bkr  -o imq.destination.logDeadMsgs=true 
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Dead message logging applies to all physical destinations that use the
dead message queue. You cannot enable or disable logging for an
individual physical destination.

Managing Broker System-Wide Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once clients are connected to the broker, the routing and delivery of
messages can proceed. In this phase, the broker is responsible for
creating and managing different types of physical destinations, ensuring
a smooth flow of messages, and using resources efficiently. You can use
the broker configuration properties described under
link:broker-properties.html#aeonu[Routing and Delivery Properties] to
manage these tasks in a way that suits your application's needs.

The performance and stability of a broker depend on the system resources
(such as memory) available and how efficiently they are utilized. You
can set configuration properties to prevent the broker from becoming
overwhelmed by incoming messages or running out of memory. These
properties function at three different levels to keep the message
service operating as resources become scarce:

* Systemwide message limits apply collectively to all physical
destinations on the system. These include the maximum number of messages
held by a broker (`imq.system.max_count`) and the maximum total number
of bytes occupied by such messages (`imq.system.max_size`). If either of
these limits is reached, the broker will reject any new messages until
the pending messages fall below the limit. There is also a limit on the
maximum size of an individual message (`imq.message.max_size`) and a
time interval at which expired messages are removed
(`imq.message.expiration.interval`).
* Individual destination limits regulate the flow of messages to a
specific physical destination. The configuration properties controlling
these limits are described in
link:physical-destination-properties.html#aeooc[Physical Destination
Property Reference]. They include limits on the number and size of
messages the destination will hold, the number of message producers and
consumers that can be created for it, and the number of messages that
can be batched together for delivery to the destination. +
The destination can be configured to respond to memory limits by slowing
down the delivery of message by message producers, by rejecting new
incoming messages, or by throwing out the oldest or lowest-priority
existing messages. Messages deleted from the destination in this way may
optionally be moved to the dead message queue rather than discarded
outright; the broker property `imq.destination.DMQ.truncateBody`
controls whether the entire message body is saved in the dead message
queue, or only the header and property data. +
As a convenience during application development and testing, you can
configure a message broker to create new physical destinations
automatically whenever a message producer or consumer attempts to access
a nonexistent destination. The broker properties summarized in
link:broker-properties.html#gbnof[Table 17-3] parallel the ones just
described, but apply to such auto-created destinations instead of
administratively created ones.
* System memory thresholds define levels of memory usage at which the
broker takes increasingly serious action to prevent memory overload.
Four such usage levels are defined:

** Green: Plenty of memory is available.

** Yellow: Broker memory is beginning to run low.

** Orange: The broker is low on memory.

** Red: The broker is out of memory. +
The memory utilization percentages defining these levels are specified
by the broker properties `imq.green.threshold`, `imq.yellow.threshold` ,
`imq.orange.threshold`, and `imq.red.threshold` , respectively; the
default values are 0% for green, 80% for yellow, 90% for orange, and 98%
for red. +
As memory usage advances from one level to the next, the broker responds
progressively, first by swapping messages out of active memory into
persistent storage and then by throttling back producers of
nonpersistent messages, eventually stopping the flow of messages into
the broker. (Both of these measures degrade broker performance.) The
throttling back of message production is done by limiting the size of
each batch delivered to the number of messages specified by the
properties `imq.`resourceState `.count`, where resourceState is `green`
, `yellow`, `orange`, or `red` , respectively.

The triggering of these system memory thresholds is a sign that
systemwide and destination message limits are set too high. Because the
memory thresholds cannot always catch potential memory overloads in
time, you should not rely on them to control memory usage, but rather
reconfigure the system-wide and destination limits to optimize memory
resources.

[[aeoek]][[GMADG00240]][[managing-durable-subscriptions]]

Managing Durable Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue clients subscribing to a topic destination can register as
durable subscribers. The corresponding durable subscription has a
unique, persistent identity and requires the broker to retain messages
addressed to it even when its message consumer (the durable subscriber)
becomes inactive. Ordinarily, the broker may delete a message held for a
durable subscriber only when the message expires.

The Message Queue Command utility provides subcommands for managing a
broker's durable subscriptions in the following ways:

* Listing durable subscriptions
* Purging all messages for a durable subscription
* Destroying a durable subscription

To list durable subscriptions for a specified physical destination, use
the `imqcmd` `list` `dur` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list dur  -d topicName
----

For example, the following command lists all durable subscriptions to
the topic `SPQuotes` on the default broker (host `localhost` at port
`7676`):

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list dur  -d SPQuotes 
----

The resulting output lists the name of each durable subscription to the
topic, the client identifier to which it belongs, its current state
(active or inactive), and the number of messages currently queued to it.
link:#genoo[Example 7-6] shows an example.

[[GMADG00112]][[genoo]]

----------------------------------------------------------------
myDurable   myClientID       1           INACTIVE
----

The `imqcmd` `purge` `dur` subcommand purges all messages for a
specified durable subscriber and client identifier:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd purge dur  -n subscriberName
                     -c clientID
----

For example, the following command purges all messages for the durable
subscription listed in link:#genoo[Example 7-6]:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd purge dur  -n myCurable  -c myClientID
----

The `imqcmd` `destroy` `dur` subcommand destroys a durable subscription,
specified by its subscriber name and client identifier:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd destroy dur  -n subscriberName
                       -c clientID
----

For example, the following command destroys the durable subscription
listed in link:#genoo[Example 7-6]:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd destroy dur  -n myCurable  -c myClientID

[[aeoel]][[GMADG00241]][[managing-transactions]]

Managing Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All transactions initiated by client applications are tracked by the
broker. These can be local Message Queue transactions or distributed
transactions managed by a distributed transaction manager.

Each transaction is identified by a unique 64-bit Message Queue
transaction identifier. Distributed transactions also have a distributed
transaction identifier (XID), up to 128 bytes long, assigned by the
distributed transaction manager. Message Queue maintains the association
between its own transaction identifiers and the corresponding XIDs.

The `imqcmd` `list` `txn` subcommand lists the transactions being
tracked by a broker:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list txn
----

This lists all transactions on the broker, both local and distributed.
For each transaction, it shows the transaction ID, state, user name,
number of messages and acknowledgments, and creation time.
link:#genop[Example 7-7] shows an example of the resulting output.

[[GMADG00113]][[genop]]

----

To display detailed information about a single transaction, obtain the
transaction identifier from `imqcmd` `list` `txn` and pass it to the
`imqcmd` `query` `txn` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query txn  -n transactionID
----

This displays the same information as `imqcmd` `list` `txn`, along with
the client identifier, connection identification, and distributed
transaction identifier (XID). For example, the command

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd query txn  -n 64248349708800 
----

produces output like that shown in link:#genpb[Example 7-8].

----

If a broker fails, it is possible that a distributed transaction could
be left in the `PREPARED` state without ever having been committed.
Until such a transaction is committed, its messages will not be
delivered and its acknowledgments will not be processed. Hence, as an
administrator, you might need to monitor such transactions and commit
them or roll them back manually. For example, if the broker's
`imq.transaction.autorollback` property (see
link:broker-properties.html#gbnod[Table 17-2]) is set to `false`, you
must manually commit or roll back non-distributed transactions and
unrecoverable distributed transactions found in the `PREPARED` state at
broker startup, using the Command utility's `commit` `txn` or `rollback`
`txn` subcommand:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd commit txn  -n transactionID
imqcmd rollback txn  -n transactionID
----

For example, the following command commits the transaction listed in
link:#genpb[Example 7-8]:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd commit txn  -n64248349708800 
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Only transactions in the PREPARED state can be committed . However,
transaction in the `STARTED`, `FAILED`, `INCOMPLETE`, `COMPLETE`, and
`PREPARED` states can be rolled back. You should do so only if you know
that the transaction has been left in this state by a failure and is not
in the process of being committed by the distributed transaction
manager.
