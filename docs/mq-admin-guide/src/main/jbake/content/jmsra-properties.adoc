20 JMS Resource Adapter Property Reference
------------------------------------------

This chapter describes the configuration properties of the Message Queue
JMS Resource Adapter (JMS RA), which enables you to integrate Message
Queue with any Java EE application server by means of the standard Java
EE connector architecture (JCA). When plugged into an application
server, the Resource Adapter allows applications deployed in that
application server to use Message Queue to send and receive JMS
messages.

The Message Queue JMS Resource Adapter exposes its configuration
properties through three JavaBean components:

* The `ResourceAdapter` JavaBean (link:#aeooo[ResourceAdapter JavaBean])
affects the behavior of the Resource Adapter as a whole.
* The `ManagedConnectionFactory` JavaBean
(link:#aeoop[ManagedConnectionFactory JavaBean]) affects connections
created by the Resource Adapter for use by message-driven beans (MDBs).
* The `ActivationSpec` JavaBean (link:#aeooq[ActivationSpec JavaBean])
affects message endpoints that represent MDBs in their interactions with
the messaging system.

To set property values for these entities, you use the tools provided by
your application server for configuration and deployment of the Resource
Adapter and for deployment of MDBs.

This chapter lists and describes the configuration properties of the
Message Queue JMS Resource Adapter. It contains the following sections:

* link:#gjzpg[About Shared Topic Subscriptions for Clustered Containers]
* link:#aeooo[ResourceAdapter JavaBean]
* link:#aeoop[ManagedConnectionFactory JavaBean]
* link:#aeooq[ActivationSpec JavaBean]

About Shared Topic Subscriptions for Clustered Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Message Queue JMS Resource Adapter provides a special feature called
shared subscriptions for containers that support clustering, such as
GlassFish Server. This feature enables clustered containers to share the
load of processing messages for topic subscriptions across the instances
of a cluster.

When this feature is enabled, the following behaviors apply:

* Attempts by multiple connections to use the same client id do not
result in an exception, provided that the connections are from different
instances in the cluster.
* Two or more subscriptions on the same topic with the same client id
and (if the subscription is durable) the same durable subscription name
are considered "shared"; that is, they are treated as a single
subscription, with each message being sent to only one of the
participating subscriptions.

The sharing of subscriptions relies on client id being set, not only for
durable subscriptions (which always require client id) but for
non-durable subscriptions (which do not normally require client id). If
the subscription is being created by the resource adapter for use by a
message-driven bean (MDB), and client id is not set, then the resource
adapter will set the client id to the name of the MDB. However if the
subscription is being created programmatically using the JMS API, and
client id is not set, then an exception will be thrown.

Note that, in the EJB or web container, applications that create a
connection using a connection factory are not permitted to set client id
on the newly created connection, but must set it on the connection
factory instead. This restriction is imposed by the EJB specification,
though it applies to web components as well. There is no such
restrictions in the application client container.

[[gkubs]][[GMADG00628]][[disabling-shared-subscriptions]]

Disabling Shared Subscriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the shared subscriptions feature is enabled. In some
applications that use non-durable subscriptions, however, the shared
behavior is not desired. In such cases, disable the shared subscriptions
feature by setting the `useSharedSubscriptionInClusteredContainer`
property to `false` on either the `ActivationSpec` or
`ManagedConnectionFactory`, as appropriate:

* For an MDB, set the `ActivationSpec` property
`useSharedSubscriptionInClusteredContainer` to `false`. Do this in
exactly the same way as with other `ActivationSpec` properties, using
annotations in the MDB itself or in the deployment descriptor
`ejb-jar.xml` or `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`. Alternatively, if the
`glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor specifies a connection
factory using the `<mdb-connection-factory>` element, then the property
can be configured on the connection factory instead, as described in the
next item.
* For GlassFish applications creating a non-durable subscription using
the JMS API rather than using an MDB, set the connection factory
property `useSharedSubscriptionInClusteredContainer` to `false` using
the GlassFish Administration Console, the GlassFish `asadmin` command or
the resource descriptor `glassfish-resources.xml`.

Only set `useSharedSubscriptionInClusteredContainer` to `false` for
non-durable subscriptions.

[[gkudu]][[GMADG00629]][[consumer-flow-control-when-shared-subscriptions-are-used]]

Consumer Flow Control When Shared Subscriptions Are Used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When shared subscriptions are being used, then consumer flow control
operates slightly differently than is described in
link:tuning.html#aeoky[Client Runtime Message Flow Adjustments].

With a normal topic subscription, the maximum number of messages that
can be held pending for any single subscriber, waiting to be consumed,
is defined by the broker property
`imq.autocreate.topic.consumerFlowLimit` for auto-created topics, or the
destination property `consumerFlowLimit` for administratively-created
topics. Both properties have a default value of 1000. This can be
overridden on a per-connection basis by setting the connection factory
property `imqConsumerFlowLimit` to a lower value than that defined for
the topic.

When the subscription is shared, however, different logic applies. In
this case, the limit is defined by the broker property
`imq.autocreate.topic.sharedConsumerFlowLimit` for auto-created topics
or the broker property `imq.admincreate.topic.sharedConsumerFlowLimit`
for all administratively-created topics. It is not possible to set this
limit on individual administratively-created topics. Both properties
have a default value of 5. This can be overridden on a per-connection
basis by setting the connection factory property `imqConsumerFlowLimit`
to a lower value than that defined for the topic. Note that, as with all
connection factory properties, this is specified using the `options`
property of the managed connection factory.

ResourceAdapter JavaBean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ResourceAdapter` configuration configures the default JMS Resource
Adapter behavior. link:#gbnny[Table 20-1] lists and describes the
properties with which you can configure this JavaBean.

|`addressListBehavior` |String |`PRIORITY` a|
Order in which to attempt connection to Message Queue service:

* `PRIORITY`: Order specified in address list
* `RANDOM`: Random order

Note: Reconnection attempts after a connection failure start with the
broker whose connection failed and proceed sequentially through the
address list, regardless of the value set for this property.

|`addressListIterations` |Integer |`1` |Number of times to iterate
through address list attempting to establish or reestablish a connection

|`reconnectEnabled` |Boolean |`false` |Attempt to reestablish a lost

|`brokerEnableHA` |Boolean |`false` |Enable high availability?

|`clusterID` |String |None a|
Cluster identifier

If specified, only brokers with the same cluster identifier can be
clustered together. In the event of broker failure, client connections
will fail over only to brokers with the same cluster identifier as the
original broker. If not specified, client connections can fail over to
any other broker with an unspecified cluster identifier.

For standalone brokers (those not belonging to a cluster), this property
is ignored.

The identifier may contain only alphabetic letters (`A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`),
numeric digits (`0`-`9`), and the underscore character (`_`).

|`brokerID` |String |None a|
Broker identifier

For brokers using a JDBC-based persistent data store, this string is
appended to the names of all database tables to make them unique in the
case where more than one broker instance is using the same database. For
brokers using a file-based data store, this property is ignored.

In an enhanced cluster, each broker must have a unique broker
identifier.

The identifier may contain only alphabetic letters (`A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`),
numeric digits (`0`-`9`), and the underscore character (`_`).
