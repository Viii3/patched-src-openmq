1 Administrative Tasks and Tools
--------------------------------

This chapter provides an overview of Open Message Queue administrative
tasks and the tools for performing them, focusing on common features of
the command line administration utilities. It consists of the following
sections:

* link:#aeoaq[Administrative Tasks]
* link:#aeoav[Administration Tools]

Administrative Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The typical administrative tasks to be performed depend on the nature of
the environment in which you are running Message Queue. The demands of a
software development environment in which Message Queue applications are
being developed and tested are different from those of a production
environment in which such applications are deployed to accomplish useful
work. The following sections summarize the typical administrative
requirements of these two different types of environment.

[[aeoar]][[GMADG00492]][[administration-in-a-development-environment]]

Administration in a Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a development environment, the emphasis is on flexibility. The
Message Queue message service is needed principally for testing
applications under development. Administration is generally minimal,
with programmers often administering their own systems. Such
environments are typically distinguished by the following
characteristics:

* Simple startup of brokers for use in testing
* Administered objects instantiated in client code rather than created
administratively
* Auto-created destinations
* File-system object store
* File-based persistence
* File-based user repository
* No master broker in multiple-broker clusters

[[aeoas]][[GMADG00493]][[administration-in-a-production-environment]]

Administration in a Production Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a production environment in which applications must be reliably
deployed and run, administration is more important. Administrative tasks
to be performed depend on the complexity of the messaging system and of
the applications it must support. Such tasks can be classified into two
general categories: setup operations and maintenance operations.

[[aeoat]][[GMADG00392]][[setup-operations]]

Setup Operations
++++++++++++++++

Administrative setup operations in a production environment typically
include some or all of the following:

Administrator security

* Setting the password for the default administrative user (`admin`)
(link:security-services.html#gewbm[Changing a User's Password])
* Controlling individual or group access to the administrative
connection service (link:security-services.html#aeofy[Authorization Rules
for Connection Services]) and the dead message queue
(link:security-services.html#aeofz[Authorization Rules for Physical
Destinations])
* Regulating administrative group access to a file-based or Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) user repository
(link:security-services.html#aeofm[User Groups and Status],
link:security-services.html#aeofr[Using an LDAP User Repository])

General security

* Managing the contents of a file-based user repository
(link:security-services.html#aeofj[Using the User Manager Utility]) or
configuring the broker to use an existing LDAP user repository
(link:security-services.html#aeofr[Using an LDAP User Repository])
* Controlling the operations that individual users or groups are
authorized to perform (link:security-services.html#aeofu[User
Authorization])
* Setting up encryption services using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
(link:security-services.html#aeogb[Message Encryption])

Administered objects

* Setting up and configuring an LDAP object store (
link:administered-objects.html#aeogw[LDAP Server Object Stores])
* Creating connection factories and destinations (
link:administered-objects.html#aeohn[Adding Administered Objects])

Broker clusters

* Creating a cluster configuration file
(link:broker-clusters.html#gejlk[The Cluster Configuration File])
* Designating a master broker (link:broker-clusters.html#aeoih[Managing a
Conventional Cluster's Configuration Change Record])

Persistence

* Configuring a broker to use a persistent store
(link:persistence-services.html#gheas[Configuring Persistence Services]).

Memory management

* Setting a destination's configuration properties to optimize its
memory usage (link:message-delivery.html#aeoes[Updating Physical
Destination Properties],
link:physical-destination-properties.html#aeooc[Physical Destination
Property Reference])

[[aeoau]][[GMADG00393]][[maintenance-operations]]

Maintenance Operations
++++++++++++++++++++++

Because application performance, reliability, and security are at a
premium in production environments, message service resources must be
tightly monitored and controlled through ongoing administrative
maintenance operations, including the following:

Broker administration and tuning

* Using broker metrics to tune and reconfigure a broker (
link:tuning.html#aeojg[Analyzing and Tuning a Message Service])
* Managing broker memory resources
(link:message-delivery.html#aeocq[Managing Broker System-Wide Memory])
* Creating and managing broker clusters to balance message load
(link:broker-clusters.html#aeohv[Configuring and Managing Broker
Clusters])
* Recovering failed brokers
(link:starting-brokers-and-clients.html#aeoby[Starting Brokers]).

Administered objects

* Adjusting connection factory attributes to ensure the correct behavior
of client applications (link:administered-objects.html#aeogz[Connection
Factory Attributes])
* Monitoring and managing physical destinations (
link:message-delivery.html#gheav[Configuring and Managing Physical
Destinations])
* Controlling user access to destinations (
link:security-services.html#aeofz[Authorization Rules for Physical
Destinations])

Client management

* Monitoring and managing durable subscriptions (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoek[Managing Durable Subscriptions]).
* Monitoring and managing transactions (see
link:message-delivery.html#aeoel[Managing Transactions]).

[[aeoav]][[GMADG00218]][[administration-tools]]

Administration Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the tools you use to configure and manageMessage
Queue broker services. The tools fall into two categories:

* link:#ggwcf[Built-in Administration Tools]
* link:#ggwao[JMX-Based Administration]

[[ggwcf]][[GMADG00494]][[built-in-administration-tools]]

Built-in Administration Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue's built-in administration tools include both command line
and GUI tools:

* link:#aeoaw[Command Line Utilities]
* link:#aeoax[Administration Console]

[[aeoaw]][[GMADG00394]][[command-line-utilities]]

Command Line Utilities
++++++++++++++++++++++

All Message Queue utilities are accessible via a command line interface.
Utility commands share common formats, syntax conventions, and options.
These utilities allow you to perform various administrative tasks, as
noted below, and therefore can require different administrative
permissions:

* The Broker utility (`imqbrokerd`) starts up brokers and specifies
their configuration properties, including connecting them together into
a cluster. Permissions: User account that initially started the broker.
* The Command utility (`imqcmd`) controls brokers and their resources
and manages physical destinations. Permissions: Message Queue admin user
account.
* The Object Manager utility (`imqobjmgr`) manages provider-independent
administered objects in an object store accessible via the Java Naming
and Directory Interface (JNDI). Permissions: Object store (flat-file or
LDAP server) access account.
* The Database Manager utility (`imqdbmgr`) creates and manages
databases for persistent storage that conform to the Java Database
Connectivity (JDBC) standard. Permissions: JDBC database manager
account.
* The User Manager utility (`imqusermgr`) populates a file-based user
repository for user authentication and authorization. Permissions: user
account that initially started the broker.
* The Service Administrator utility ( `imqsvcadmin`) installs and
manages a broker as a Windows service. Permissions: Administrator.
* The Key Tool utility (`imqkeytool`) generates self-signed certificates
for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication. Permissions: root user
(Solaris and Linux platforms) or Administrator (Windows platform).

The executable files for the above command line utilities are in the
`IMQ_HOME/bin` directory.

See link:command-line-reference.html#aeonc[Command Line Reference] for
detailed information on the use of these utilities.

[[aeoax]][[GMADG00395]][[administration-console]]

Administration Console
++++++++++++++++++++++

The Message Queue Administration Console combines some of the
capabilities of the Command and Object Manager utilities. You can use it
to perform the following tasks:

* Connect to and control a broker remotely
* Create and manage physical destinations
* Create and manage administered objects in a JNDI object store

However, you cannot use the Administration Console to perform such tasks
as starting up a broker, creating broker clusters, managing a JDBC
database or a user repository, installing a broker as a Windows service,
or generating SSL certificates. For these, you need the other command
line utilities (Broker, Database Manager, User Manager, Service
Administrator, and Key Tool), which cannot operate remotely and must be
run on the same host as the broker they manage (see link:#gbngk[Figure
1-1]).

all other utilities must reside on the broker's host."]


See link:quick-start.html#aeoay[Quick-Start Tutorial] for a brief,
hands-on introduction to the Administration Console. More detailed
information on its use is available through its own help facility.

[[ggwao]][[GMADG00495]][[jmx-based-administration]]

JMX-Based Administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To serve customers who need a standard programmatic means to monitor and
access the broker, Message Queue also supports the Java Management
Extensions (JMX) architecture, which allows a Java application to manage
broker resources programmatically.

* Resources include everything that you can manipulate using the Command
utility (`imqcmd`) and the Message Queue Admin Console: the broker,
connection services, connections, destinations, durable subscribers,
transactions, and so on.
* Management includes the ability to dynamically configure and monitor
resources, and the ability to obtain notifications about state changes
and error conditions.

JMX is the Java standard for building management applications. Message
Queue is based on the JMX 1.2 specification, which is part of JDK 1.5.

For information on the broker's JMX infrastructure and how to configure
the broker to support JMX client applications, see
link:jmx-support.html#geoel[JMX Support].

To manage a Message Queue broker using the JMX architecture, see the
link:../mq-dev-guide-jmx/toc.html#GMJMG[Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for JMX Clients].
