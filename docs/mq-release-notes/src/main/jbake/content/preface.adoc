Typographic Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table describes the typographic conventions that are used
in this book.

[width="100%",cols="14%,44%,42%",options="header",]

|Typeface |Meaning |Example
|`AaBbCc123` |The names of commands, files, and directories, and
onscreen computer output a|
Edit your `.login` file.

Use `ls` `a` to list all files.

`machine_name% you have mail.`

|`AaBbCc123` |What you type, contrasted with onscreen computer output a|
`machine_name%` `su`

`Password:`

|aabbcc123 |Placeholder: replace with a real name or value |The command
to remove a file is `rm`Â filename.

|AaBbCc123 |Book titles, new terms, and terms to be emphasized a|
Read Chapter 6 in the User's Guide.

A cache is a copy that is stored locally.

Do not save the file.

[[shell-prompt-conventions]]
Shell Prompt Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table shows the conventions used in Message Queue
documentation for the default UNIX system prompt and superuser prompt

[[directory-variable-conventions]]
Directory Variable Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue documentation makes use of three directory variables; two
of which represent environment variables needed by Message Queue. (How
you set the environment variables varies from platform to platform.)

The following table describes the directory variables that might be
found in this book and how they are used. Some of these variables refer
to the directory mqInstallHome, which is the directory where Message
Queue is installed to when using the installer or unzipped to when using
a zip-based distribution.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In this book, directory variables are shown without platform-specific
environment variable notation or syntax (such as `$IMQ_HOME` on UNIX).
Non-platform-specific path names use UNIX directory separator (`/`)
notation.

=======================================================================


[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Description
|`IMQ_HOME` a|
The Message Queue home directory:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_HOME` is as-install-parent`/mq`, where as-install-parent is the
parent directory of the GlassFish Server base installation directory,
`glassfish5` by default for MQ 5.1.3 and GlassFish 4.1 for MQ 5.0.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` is
mqInstallHome`/mq`.

|`IMQ_VARHOME` a|
The directory in which Message Queue temporary or dynamically created
configuration and data files are stored; `IMQ_VARHOME` can be explicitly
set as an environment variable to point to any directory or will default
as described below:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_VARHOME` defaults to
as-install-parent`/glassfish/domains/domain1/imq`.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` defaults to
mqInstallHome`/var/mq`.

|`IMQ_JAVAHOME` |An environment variable that points to the location of
the Java runtime environment (JRE) required by Message Queue executable
files. By default, Message Queue looks for and uses the latest JDK, but
you can optionally set the value of `IMQ_JAVAHOME` to wherever the
preferred JRE resides.
