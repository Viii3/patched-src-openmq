3 The JMS Simplified API
------------------------

This chapter describes the JMS Simplified API defined by the Java
Message Service (JMS) 2.0 specification and implemented in the Message
Queue Java API.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The JMS Classic API offers the same functionality and is described in
link:using-the-java-api.html#aeqax[The JMS Classic API]. For detailed
reference information, see the JavaDoc documentation for each individual
class.

=======================================================================


The topics covered include the following:

* link:#BABCIBDI[Using the Simplified API]
* link:#BABCEIJG[Developing a JMS Client using the Simplified API]
* link:#BABFIDDI[Working With Connections]
* link:#BABHBBGG[Working With Destinations]
* link:#BABFJEHJ[Working With Messages]

[[BABCIBDI]][[GMJVG346]][[using-the-simplified-api]]

Using the Simplified API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Simplified API provides the same basic functionality as the Classic
API but requires fewer interfaces and is simpler to use.

The main interfaces are:

* `ConnectionFactory`—An administered object used by a client to create
a `Connection`. This interface is also used by the Classic API.
* `JMSContext`—An active connection to a JMS provider and a
single-threaded context used to send or receive messages.
* `JMSProducer`—An object created by a `JMSContext` to send messages to
a queue or topic.
* `JMSConsumer`—An object created by a `JMSContext` to receive messages
sent to a.queue or topic

In the Simplified API, the `JMSContext` combines the behaviors of the
Classic API `Connection` and `Session` objects. A `Connection` continues
to represent a physical link to a JMS server. A `Session` continues to
represent a single-threaded context for sending or receiving messages.
link:#BABJJEDE[Figure 3-1] shows an overview of the Simplified API.

[[using-the-autocloseable-interface]]
Using the Autocloseable Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Objects from interfaces that extend the `java.lang.Autocloseable` and
use a `try-with-resources` statement do not need to explicitly call
`close()` when these objects are no longer required.

The following interfaces extend the `java.lang.Autocloseable` interface:

* `JMSContext`
* `JMSConsumer`
* `QueueBrowser`

For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
. . .
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();){
   // use context in this try block
   // it will be closed when try block completes
} catch (JMSException e){
   // exception handling
}
. . .
----

[[GMJVG439]][[sthref15]]


[[simplified-extraction-of-message-bodies]]
Simplified Extraction of Message Bodies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the `getBody` method to provide a convenient way to obtain
the body from a newly-received `Message` object. Use `getBody` to:

* Return the body of a `TextMessage`, `MapMessage`, or `BytesMessage` as
a `String`, `Map`, or `byte[]` without the need to cast the `Message`
first to the appropriate subtype.
* Return the body of an `ObjectMessage` without the need to cast the
`Message` to `ObjectMessage`, extract the body as a `Serializable`, and
cast it to the specified type.

The `isBodyAssignableTo` method can be used to determine whether a
subsequent call to `getBody` would be able to return the body of a
particular `Message` object as a particular type.

[[BABCEIJG]][[GMJVG431]][[developing-a-jms-client-using-the-simplified-api]]

Developing a JMS Client using the Simplified API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides the basic steps required to create a JMS client
using the Simplified API.

* Use JNDI to find a `ConnectionFactory` object.
* Use JNDI to find one or more `Destination` objects.
* Use the `ConnectionFactory` to create a `JMSContext` object.
* Use the `JMSContext` to create the `JMSProducer` and `JMSConsumer`
objects needed.
* Delivery of message is started automatically. +

[[BABFIDDI]][[GMJVG347]][[working-with-connections]]

Working With Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simplified API a connection and a session are represented by a
single `JMSContext` object. When a `JMSContext` is created the
underlying session is created automatically.

Since a `JMSContext` incorporates a session, it is subject to the same
threading restrictions as a session. This means that it may only be used
by one thread at a time (single-threaded).

* The `JMSContext` method `createContext` does not use its underlying
session and is not subject to the single-threading restriction.
* The `close` method on `JMSContext` or `JMSConsumer` is not
single-threaded since closing a session or consumer from another thread
is permitted.
* By default, when `createConsumer` or `createDurableConsumer` is used
to create a `JMSConsumer`, the connection is automatically started. If
`setMessageListener` is called to configure the asynchronous delivery of
messages, the `JMSContext`'s session immediately becomes dedicated to
the thread of control that delivers messages to the listener. The
application must not subsequently call methods on the `JMSContext` from
another thread of control. However, this restriction does not apply to
applications which call `setMessageListener` to set a second or
subsequent message listener. The JMS provider is responsible for
ensuring that a second message listener may be safely configured even if
the underlying connection has been started.

See http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jms-concepts.html["The
JMS API Programming Model"] in The Java EE 7 Tutorial for additional
information.

[[BABHBBGG]][[GMJVG358]][[working-with-destinations]]

Working With Destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Message Queue messages travel from a message producer to a message
consumer by way of a destination on a message broker. Message delivery
is thus a two-stage process: the message is first delivered from the
producer to the destination and later from the destination to the
consumer. Physical destinations on the broker are created
administratively by a Message Queue administrator, using the
administration tools described in "link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00238[Configuring and
Managing Physical Destinations]" in Open Message Queue Administration
Guide. The broker provides routing and delivery services for messages
sent to such a destination.

Message Queue supports two types of destination, depending on the
messaging domain being used:

* Queues (point-to-point domain)
* Topics (publish/subscribe domain)

These two types of destination are represented by the Message Queue
classes `Queue` and `Topic`, respectively. These, in turn, are both
subclasses of the generic class `Destination`. A client program that
uses the `Destination` superclass can thus handle both queue and topic
destinations indiscriminately.

See http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jms-concepts.html["The
JMS API Programming Model"] in The Java EE 7 Tutorial for additional
information.

Working With Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use the Message Queue Java API to compose,
send, receive, and process messages. See
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jms-concepts.html["The JMS
API Programming Model"] in The Java EE 7 Tutorial for additional
information.

[[message-structure]]
Message Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following section provides information on message structure:

* A header containing identifying and routing information.
* Optional properties that can be used to convey additional identifying
information beyond that contained in the header
* A body containing the actual content of the message.

For more information, see link:using-the-java-api.html#aeqbn[Message
Structure].

[[BABGEIDC]][[GMJVG432]][[message-headers]]

Message Headers
+++++++++++++++

Every message must have a header containing identifying and routing
information. The header consists of a set of standard fields, which are
defined in the Java Message Service Specification and summarized in
link:#BABEFEGC[Table 3-1]. Some of these are set automatically by
Message Queue in the course of producing and delivering a message, some
depend on settings specified when a message producer sends a message,
and others are set by the client on a message-by-message basis.

[[GMJVG433]][[sthref18]][[BABEFEGC]]


Table 3-1 Message Header Fields

[width="100%",cols="39%,61%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================

[[BABFAGED]][[GMJVG372]][[changes-for-standard-jms-2.0-message-properties]]

Changes for Standard JMS 2.0 Message Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The JMS specification defines certain standard properties, listed in
link:#BABBDBII[Table 3-4]. By convention, the names of all such standard
properties begin with the letters `JMSX`; names of this form are
reserved and must not be used by a client application for its own custom
message properties. These properties are not enabled by default, an
application must set the name/value pairs it requires on the appropriate
connection factory.

The JMS 2.0 specification requires that JMS producers set the
`JMSXDeliveryCount`. This property was not supported prior to MQ 5.0.

|=======================================================================


[[BABIJCJD]][[GMJVG387]][[sending-messages]]

Sending Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to send messages to a message broker, you must create a
`JMSProducer` object using the `createProducer()` method on
`JMSContext`. For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();){context.createProducer().send(inboundQueue,body)
}
----

The JMS 2.0 specification allows a client to specify a delivery delay
value, in milliseconds, for each message it sends. This value is used to
determine a messages's delivery time which is calculated by adding the
delivery delay value specified on the send to the time the message was
sent. See link:#BABGEIDC[Message Headers].

link:#BABHGBAJ[Table 3-5] shows the methods defined in the `JMSProducer`
interface.

[[GMJVG388]][[sthref22]][[BABHGBAJ]]

[[simplified-api-methods-for-asynchronous-sends]]
Simplified API methods for Asynchronous Sends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Simplified API, a JMS provider sends a message asynchronously by
calling `setAsync(CompletionListener completionListener)` on the
`JMSProducer` prior to calling one of the following `send` methods:

* `send(Destination destination, Message message)`
* `send(Destination destination, String body)`
* `send(Destination destination, Map<String,Object> body)`
* `send(Destination destination, byte[] body)`
* `send(Destination destination, Serializable body)`
* `send(Destination destination, String body)`


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

These `send` methods are the same as methods that are used for a
synchronous send. However, calling `setAsync` beforehand changes their
behavior.

=======================================================================


For more information on how to convert common synchronous send design
patterns to use asynchronous sends, see
link:using-the-java-api.html#BGBGDFBA[Asynchronous send].

[[BABECHCG]][[GMJVG389]][[receiving-messages]]

Receiving Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides information on new behaviors and two new
subscription types for clients to use when consuming messages.

[[GMJVG446]][[sthref24]]


[[using-shared-non-durable-subscriptions]]
Using Shared Non-durable Subscriptions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A shared non-durable subscription is used by a client that needs to be
able to share the work of receiving messages from a non-durable topic
subscription across multiple consumers. Each message from the
subscription is delivered to only one of the consumers that may exist on
that subscription.

Shared non-durable subscriptions are created and a consumer crated on
the subscription using one of the following:

* Classic API: One of the `createSharedConsumer` methods on `Session`
which return a `MessageConsumer` object.
* Simplified API: One of the `createSharedConsumer` methods on
`JMSContext` which returns a `JMSContext` object.

A shared non-durable subscription exists only as long as there is an
active consumer on the subscription. It is identified by name and an
optional client identifier (`clientId`). If the client identifier was
set when the subscription was created, any client that creates a
consumer on that shared non-durable subscription must use the same
client identifier. This type of subscription is not persisted and is
deleted, along with any undelivered messages, when the last consumer on
the subscription is deleted. The `noLocal` parameter is not supported
for shared non-durable subscriptions.

[[GMJVG447]][[sthref25]]


[[using-shared-durable-subscriptions]]
Using Shared Durable Subscriptions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A shared durable subscription is used by an application that needs to
share the work of receiving all the messaged published on a topic,
including messages published when no consumers are associated with the
subscription. Each message from the subscription is delivered to only
one of the consumers that may exist on that subscription. For this
subscription type, the JMS provider ensures all the messages from the
topic's publishers:

* Are Delivered and acknowledged or
* Have expired

Shared durable subscriptions are created and a consumer crated on the
subscription using one of the following:

* Classic API: One of the `createSharedDurableConsumer` methods on
`Session` which return a `MessageConsumer` object.
* Simplified API: One of the `createSharedDurableConsumer` methods on
`JMSContext` which returns a `JMSContext` object.

A shared durable e subscription persists and accumulates messages until
it is explicitly deleted using the `unsubscribe` method on either
`Session` or `JMSContext`. You cannot delete a durable subscription with
an active consumer or while a message is received from the subscription
is part of a transaction. It is identified by name and an optional
client identifier (`clientId`). If the client identifier was set when
the subscription was created, any client that creates a consumer on that
shared non-durable subscription must use the same client identifier. The
`noLocal` parameter is not supported for shared durable subscriptions.

[[GMJVG448]][[sthref26]]


[[starting-message-delivery]]
Starting Message Delivery
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

An application using the Classic API to consume messages needs to call
the connection's `start` method to start delivery of incoming messages.
It may temporarily suspend delivery by calling `stop`, after which a
call to `start` will restart delivery.

The Simplified API provides corresponding `start` and `stop` methods on
`JMSContext`. The `start` method is be called automatically when
`createConsumer` or `createDurableConsumer` are called on the
`JMSContext` object. There is no need for the application to call
`start` when the consumer is first established. An application may
temporarily suspend delivery by calling `stop`, after which a call to
`start` will restart delivery.

In some situations, an application using the Simplified API may need a
connection to remain in stopped mode while setup is being completed and
not commence message delivery until the `start` method is explicitly
called. You can configure this behavior by calling `setAutoStart(false)`
on the `JMSContext` prior to calling `createConsumer` or
`createDurableConsumer`.

[[BABGJDBF]][[GMJVG402]][[processing-messages]]

Processing Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processing a message after you have received it may entail examining its
header fields, properties, and body.

[[GMJVG403]][[sthref27]]


[[retrieving-message-header-fields]]
Retrieving Message Header Fields
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The standard JMS message header fields are described in
link:#BABBDBII[Table 3-4]. link:#BABDBDHA[Table 3-6] shows the methods
provided by the JMS `Message` interface for retrieving the values of
these fields: for instance, you can obtain a message's reply destination
with the statement:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Destination replyDest = inMsg.getJMSReplyTo();
----
