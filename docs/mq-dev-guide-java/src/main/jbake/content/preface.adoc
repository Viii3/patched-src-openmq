[[who-should-use-this-book]]
Who Should Use This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is meant principally for developers of Java applications that
use Message Queue.

These applications use the Java Message Service (JMS) Application
Programming Interface (API), and possibly the SOAP with Attachments API
for Java (SAAJ), to create, send, receive, and read messages. As such,
these applications are JMS clients and/or SOAP client applications,
respectively. The JMS and SAAJ specifications are open standards.

This book assumes that you are familiar with the JMS APIs and with JMS
programming guidelines. Its purpose is to help you optimize your JMS
client applications by making best use of the features and flexibility
of a Message Queue messaging system.

This book assumes no familiarity, however, with SAAJ. This material is
described in link:soap-messages.html#aeqex[Chapter 6, "Working with SOAP
Messages"] and assumes only basic knowledge of XML.

[[before-you-read-this-book]]
Before You Read This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must read the link:../mq-tech-over/toc.html#GMTOV[Open Message Queue Technical Overview] to
become familiar with the Message Queue implementation of the Java
Message Specification, with the components of the Message Queue service,
and with the basic process of developing, deploying, and administering a
Message Queue application.

of the Message Queue Java interface. It includes a tutorial that
acquaints you with the Message Queue development environment using a
simple example JMS client application.

|link:client-design-and-features.html#aeqcq[Chapter 2, "Message Queue
Clients: Design and Features"] + |Describes architectural and
configuration issues that depend upon Message Queue's implementation of
the Java Message Specification.

|link:using-the-simplifed-java-api.html#BGBFAEAG[Chapter 3, "The JMS
Simplified API"] + |Explains how to use the simplified API introduced by
the Java Message Service (JMS) specification, Version 2.0, in your
client application.

|link:using-the-java-api.html#aeqax[Chapter 4, "The JMS Classic API"] +
|Explains how to use the Message Queue Java API in your client
application.

|link:using-the-metrics-monitoring-api.html#aeqej[Chapter 5, "Using the
Metrics Monitoring API"] + |Describes message-based monitoring, a
customized solution to metrics gathering that allows metrics data to be
accessed programmatically and then to be processed in whatever way suits
the consuming client.

|link:soap-messages.html#aeqex[Chapter 6, "Working with SOAP Messages"] +
|Explains how you send and receive SOAP messages with and without
Message Queue support.

|link:warning-messages_error-codes.html#aeqgo[Appendix A, "Warning
Messages and Client Error Codes"] + |Provides reference information for
warning messages and error codes returned by the Message Queue client
runtime when it raises a JMS exception.

[[GMJVG00182]][[gbqig]]


[[directory-variable-conventions]]
Directory Variable Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue documentation makes use of three directory variables; two
of which represent environment variables needed by Message Queue. (How
you set the environment variables varies from platform to platform.)

The following table describes the directory variables that might be
found in this book and how they are used. Some of these variables refer
to the directory mqInstallHome, which is the directory where Message
Queue is installed to when using the installer or unzipped to when using
a zip-based distribution.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In this book, directory variables are shown without platform-specific
environment variable notation or syntax (such as `$IMQ_HOME` on UNIX).
Non-platform-specific path names use UNIX directory separator (`/`)
notation.

=======================================================================


[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Description
|`IMQ_HOME` a|
The Message Queue home directory:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_HOME` is as-install-parent`/mq`, where as-install-parent is the
parent directory of the GlassFish Server base installation directory,
`glassfish3` by default.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` is
mqInstallHome`/mq`.

|`IMQ_VARHOME` a|
The directory in which Message Queue temporary or dynamically created
configuration and data files are stored; `IMQ_VARHOME` can be explicitly
set as an environment variable to point to any directory or will default
as described below:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_VARHOME` defaults to
as-install-parent`/glassfish/domains/domain1/imq`.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` defaults to
mqInstallHome`/var/mq`.

|`IMQ_JAVAHOME` |An environment variable that points to the location of
the Java runtime environment (JRE) required by Message Queue executable
files. By default, Message Queue looks for and uses the latest JDK, but
you can optionally set the value of `IMQ_JAVAHOME` to wherever the
preferred JRE resides.
