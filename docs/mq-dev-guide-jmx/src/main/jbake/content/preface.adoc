Preface
-------

This Developer's Guide for JMX Clients describes the application
programming interface provided in Message Queue for programmatically
configuring and monitoring Message Queue resources in conformance with
the Java Management Extensions (JMX). These functions are also available
to system administrators by way of the Message Queue Administration
Console and command line utilities, as described in the Open Message
Queue Administration Guide; the API described here makes the same
administrative functionality available programmatically from within a
running client application. Broker properties and command-line options
that support the JMX API are described in the Open Message Queue
Administration Guide .

[[who-should-use-this-book]]
Who Should Use This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is intended for Java application developers wishing to use
the Message Queue JMX API to perform Message Queue administrative tasks
programmatically from within a client application.

[[GMJMG00020]][[gblxf]]


[[before-you-read-this-book]]
Before You Read This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide assumes that you are already familiar with general Message
Queue concepts, administrative operations, and Java client programming,
as described in the following manuals:

* Open Message Queue Technical Overview
* Open Message Queue Administration Guide
* Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients

You should also be familiar with the general principles of the Java
Management Extensions, as described in the following publications:

* Java Management Extensions Instrumentation and Agent Specification
* Java Management Extensions (JMX) Remote API Specification

Together, these two publications are referred to hereafter as the JMX
Specification.

[[GMJMG00160]][[gbqig]]


[[directory-variable-conventions]]
Directory Variable Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue documentation makes use of three directory variables; two
of which represent environment variables needed by Message Queue. (How
you set the environment variables varies from platform to platform.)

The following table describes the directory variables that might be
found in this book and how they are used. Some of these variables refer
to the directory mqInstallHome, which is the directory where Message
Queue is installed to when using the installer or unzipped to when using
a zip-based distribution.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In this book, directory variables are shown without platform-specific
environment variable notation or syntax (such as `$IMQ_HOME` on UNIX).
Non-platform-specific path names use UNIX directory separator (`/`)
notation.

=======================================================================


[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Description
|`IMQ_HOME` a|
The Message Queue home directory:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_HOME` is as-install-parent`/mq`, where as-install-parent is the
parent directory of the GlassFish Server base installation directory,
`glassfish3` by default.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` is
mqInstallHome`/mq`.

|`IMQ_VARHOME` a|
The directory in which Message Queue temporary or dynamically created
configuration and data files are stored; `IMQ_VARHOME` can be explicitly
set as an environment variable to point to any directory or will default
as described below:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_VARHOME` defaults to
as-install-parent`/glassfish/domains/domain1/imq`.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` defaults to
mqInstallHome`/var/mq`.

|`IMQ_JAVAHOME` |An environment variable that points to the location of
the Java runtime environment (JRE) required by Message Queue executable
files. By default, Message Queue looks for and uses the latest JDK, but
you can optionally set the value of `IMQ_JAVAHOME` to wherever the
preferred JRE resides.
