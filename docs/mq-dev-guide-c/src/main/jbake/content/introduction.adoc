1 Introduction
--------------

This chapter summarizes the differences between the C API and the Java
API to Message Queue and provides a quick start to compiling and running
Message Queue C clients. It covers the following topics:

* link:#aelap[Message Queue for the C Developer]
* link:#aelaq[Building and Running C Clients]
* link:#aelaw[Working With the Sample C-Client Programs]
* link:#aelaz[Client Application Deployment Considerations]

You should be familiar with the concepts presented in the Open Message
Queue Technical Overview before you read this chapter.

Depending on your needs, after you read this chapter, you can proceed
either to link:client-design-issues.html#aelcp[Chapter 3, "Client Design
Issues"], which describes the major issues governing C client design, or
to link:using-the-c-api.html#aelba[Chapter 2, "Using the C API"], which
explains how you use C data types and functions to obtain the messaging
behavior that interests you.

The term "C developer" is used generically throughout this book and
includes the C++ developer as well.

[[aelap]][[GMCCG00036]][[message-queue-for-the-c-developer]]

Message Queue for the C Developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Message Queue product is an enterprise messaging system that
implements the Java Message Specification (JMS) standard as a JMS
provider. Message Queue developers can use two programming interfaces to
establish a connection to the broker, and send or receive messages:

* C clients use the API described in this manual to send messages to and
retrieve messages from a Message Queue broker.
* Java clients use the Java API, described in the link:../mq-tech-over/toc.html#GMTOV[Open
Message Queue Technical Overview], to send messages to and receive
messages from a Message Queue broker.

Message Queue provides a C API to its messaging services to enable
legacy C applications and C++ applications to participate in JMS-based
messaging. It is important to understand however that the Java Message
Service specification is a standard for Java clients only; thus the C
API described in this book is specific to the Message Queue provider and
cannot be used with other JMS providers. A messaging application that
includes a C client cannot be handled by another JMS provider.

The C interface, compared to the Java interface, does not support the
following features:

* The use of administered objects
* Map, stream, or object message types
* Consumer-based flow control
* Queue browsers
* JMS application server facilities (ConnectionConsumer, distributed
transactions)
* Receiving or sending SOAP messages
* Receiving or sending compressed JMS messages
* Auto-reconnect or failover, which allows the client runtime to
automatically reconnect to a broker if a connection fails
* The `NO_ACKNOWLEDGE` mode

Like the Java interface, the C interface does support the following:

* Publish/subscribe and point-to-point connections
* Synchronous and asynchronous receives
* `CLIENT`, `AUTO`, and `DUPS_OK` acknowledgement modes
* Local transactions
* Session recover
* Temporary topics and queues
* Message selectors

The JMS programming model is the foundation for the design of a Message
Queue C client. link:using-the-c-api.html#aelba[Using the C API] explains
how this model is implemented by the C data types and functions used by
a Message Queue C client for delivery of messages.

The next section provides a quick introduction to building and running
Message Queue clients.

[[aelaq]][[GMCCG00037]][[building-and-running-c-clients]]

Building and Running C Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue provides several sample Message Queue C-client
applications that illustrate how to send and receive messages. Before
you run these applications, read through the next two sections to make
sure that you understand the general procedure and requirements for
building and running Message Queue C-client programs.

[[aelar]][[GMCCG00304]][[building-c-clients]]

Building C Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section explains how you build Message Queue programs from C source
files. You should already be familiar with writing and compiling C
applications.

[[aelas]][[GMCCG00063]][[header-files-and-shared-libraries]]

Header Files and Shared Libraries
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Message Queue C client includes the header files (`mqcrt.h`), the C
client runtime shared library `mqcrt`, and its direct dependency
libraries. When writing a Message Queue C client application, you should
include the header files and link to the runtime library `mqcrt`.

The header files are located in `IMQ_HOME/include`, and the 32-bit
runtime library is located in `IMQ_HOME/lib`. A 64-bit runtime library
is available for the following platforms in the specified location:

* Linux: `IMQ_HOME/lib64`
* Solaris SPARC: `IMQ_HOME/lib/sparcv9`
* Solaris x86: `IMQ_HOME/lib/amd64`

[[aelat]][[GMCCG00064]][[pre-processor-definitions]]

Pre-Processor Definitions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the appropriate compiler for your platform, as described in the
link:../mq-release-notes/toc.html#GMRLN[Open Message Queue Release Notes].

When compiling a Message Queue C client application, you need to specify
the pre-processor definition shown for each platform in
link:#gblya[Table 1-1]. This definition is used to support Message Queue
fixed-size integer types.

[[GMCCG419]][[sthref3]][[gblya]]


Table 1-1 Preprocessor Definitions for Supporting Fixed-Size Integer
Types

|Platform |Definition
|Solaris |SOLARIS
|Linux |LINUX
|AIX |AIX
|Windows |WIN32
|====================


[[aelau]][[GMCCG00065]][[c-runtime-library-support]]

C++ Runtime Library Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When building a Message Queue C client application, you should be aware
that the Message Queue C runtime library is a multi-threaded library and
requires C++ runtime library support:

* On Solaris, this support is provided by the Oracle Solaris Studio
`libCrun` C++ runtime library.
* On Linux, this support is provided by the `gcc/g++ libstdc++` runtime
library.
* On AIX, this support is provided by the C++ runtime library in the in
the XLC/C++ Runtime Environment.
* On Windows, this support is provided by Microsoft Windows Visual C++
runtime library `msvcrt`.

[[aelav]][[GMCCG00305]][[providing-runtime-support]]

Providing Runtime Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run a Message Queue C-client application, you need to make sure that
the application can find the `mqcrt` shared library. Please consult the
documentation for your compiler to determine the best way to do this.

You also need to make sure that the appropriate C++ runtime support
library, as described in link:#aelau[C++ Runtime Library Support] is
available.

On Windows you also need to make sure that your application can find the
dependent libraries NSPR and NSS that are shipped with Message Queue.
These may be different from the NSPR and NSS libraries that are
installed on your system to support the Netscape browser and GlassFish
Server. The `mqcrt` shared library depends directly on the NSPR and NSS
versions installed with Message Queue. If a different version of the
libraries is loaded at runtime, you may get a runtime error specifying
that the libraries being used are incompatible. If this happens, look on
your system to see if other versions of the NSPR or NSS libraries exist;
for example, `libnspr4.dll` or `nss3.dll`. If you find such versions,
take appropriate action to make sure that Message Queue can access the
versions it needs.

[[aelaw]][[GMCCG00038]][[working-with-the-sample-c-client-programs]]

Working With the Sample C-Client Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the sample C-Client programs that are installed
with Message Queue and explains how you should build them and run them.

Message Queue provides two sets of sample C-client programs: basic
C-client programs and distributed transaction programs.

[[ghetd]][[GMCCG00306]][[basic-c-client-programs]]

Basic C-Client Programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sample C-client program files include the following:

[[GMCCG420]][[sthref4]][[ghesh]]


Table 1-2 Basic C-Client Sample Program Files

[width="100%",cols="34%,66%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Sample Program |Description
|`Producer.c` |Illustrates how you send a message

|`Consumer.c` |Illustrates how you receive a message synchronously

|`ProducerAsyncConsumer.c` |Illustrates how you send a message and
receive it asynchronously

|`RequestReply.c` |Illustrates how you send and respond to a message
that specifies a reply-to destination
|=======================================================================


These sample programs are located in `IMQ_HOME/examples/C`.

[[aelax]][[GMCCG00066]][[building-the-basic-c-client-sample-programs]]

Building the Basic C-Client Sample Programs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following commands illustrate the process of building and linking
the sample application `Producer.c` on the Solaris, Linux, AIX, and
Windows platforms. The commands include the pre-processor definitions
needed to support Message Queue C-API fixed-size integer types. For
options used to support multithreading, please consult documentation for
your compiler.

[[gblwy]][[GMCCG00007]][[to-compile-and-link-on-solaris-os]]

To Compile and Link on Solaris OS

Use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
CC -compat=5 -mt -DSOLARIS -Iheader_path -o Producer \\
    -Lruntime_path -lmqcrt Producer.c
----

where header_path and runtime_path are the paths to the Message Queue
header file and runtime shared library appropriate to your processor
architecture, as listed in link:#aelas[Header Files and Shared
Libraries].

For 64-bit support on either the SPARC or x86 processor architecture,
you must also specify the `-xarch` compiler option:

* SPARC: `-xarch=v9`
* x86: `-xarch=amd64`

For example, to compile and link the example application Solaris SPARC
64–bit, you would use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
CC -compat=5 -mt -xarch=v9 -DSOLARIS -I$IMQ_HOME/include -o Producer \\
-L$IMQ_HOME/lib/sparcv9 -lmqcrt Producer.c
----

[[gblxj]][[GMCCG00008]][[to-compile-and-link-on-linux]]

To Compile and Link on Linux

Use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
g++ -DLINUX -D_REENTRANT -I$IMQ_HOME/include -o Producer \\
-L$IMQ_HOME/lib -lmqcrt Producer.c
----

[[ghpfc]][[GMCCG00009]][[to-compile-and-link-on-aix]]

To Compile and Link on AIX

Use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
xlC_r -qthreaded -DAIX -I$IMQ_HOME/include -o Producer \\
-blibsuff:so -l$IMQ_HOME/lib -imqcrt Producer.c
----

[[gblyb]][[GMCCG00010]][[to-compile-and-link-on-windows]]

To Compile and Link on Windows

Use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cl /c /MD -DWIN32 -I%IMQ_HOME%\include Producer.c

link Producer.obj /NODEFAULTLIB msvcrt.lib \\
/LIBPATH:%IMQ_HOME%\lib mqcrt.lib
----

[[aelay]][[GMCCG00067]][[running-the-basic-c-client-sample-programs]]

Running the Basic C-Client Sample Programs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before you run any sample programs, you should start the broker. You can
display output describing the command-line options for each program by
starting the program with the -`help` option.

For example, the following command, runs the program `Producer`. It
specifies that the program should connect to the broker running on the
host `MyHost` and port `8585`, and that it should send a message to the
destination `My Topic` :

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Producer -h MyHost -p 8585 -d MyTopic
----

The directories that contain the sample programs also include a `README`
file that explains how you should run their respective samples.

[[gherr]][[GMCCG00307]][[distributed-transaction-sample-programs]]

Distributed Transaction Sample Programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The distributed transaction sample programs show how to use the X/Open
distributed transaction (XA) support of the Message Queue C-API with an
X/Open distributed transaction processing system (in this case Oracle
Tuxedo:
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/tuxedo/overview/index.html`.)

The distributed transaction sample programs include the following files:

[[GMCCG421]][[sthref5]][[gherq]]


Table 1-3 Distributed Transaction Sample Program Files

[width="100%",cols="38%,62%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Sample Program |Description
|`jmsserver.c` |Implements Tuxedo services that send and receive
messages using the Message Queue C-API

|`jmsclient_sender.c` |Tuxedo client that uses the message producing
service in `jmsserver.c`

|`jmsclient_receiver.c` |Tuxedo client that uses the message receiving
service in `jmsserver.c`

|`async_jmsserver.c` |Implements a Tuxedo service that asynchronously
consumes messages using the Message Queue C-API

|`jmsclient_async_receiver.c` |Tuxedo client that uses the asynchronous
message consuming service in `async_jmsserver.c`
|=======================================================================


These sample programs are located in `IMQ_HOME/examples/C/tuxedo`.

The following procedures document how to set up Tuxedo as a distributed
transaction manager, how to build the sample distributed transaction
programs, and how to run the sample programs. The procedures are based
on the synchronous message consumption samples and assume a Solaris
operating system platform.

Client Application Deployment Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are ready to deploy your client application, you should make
sure the administrator knows your application's needs. The following
checklist shows the basic information required. Consult with your
administrator to determine the exact information needed. In some cases,
it might be useful to provide a range of values rather than a specific
value. Refer to "link:../mq-admin-guide/physical-destination-properties.html#GMADG00049[Physical Destination Property
Reference]" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide about attribute
names and default values.

* Configuring physical destinations:

** Type:

** Name:

** Properties:

** Maximum number of messages expected:

** Maximum message bytes expected:
* Configuring Dead Message Queue:

** Place dead messages on Dead Message Queue:

** Log the placement of messages on the Dead Message Queue:

** Discard the body of messages placed on the Dead Message Queue:
